 I’m a lucky cat. I don’t work Fridays. So I was sitting at home on Friday evening when I thought to myself, I might as well go out. I had shown my face at Molly Magees a couple too many times as of late, so I decided to switch it up. Downtown SJ has far too many naysayers despite being a generally fun place to go. I mean, how many places in the world do you know where you can get a wonderful and creamy mango lassi to start the evening, and a drunken burrito past midnight. Plus, I wanted to check out a place I had found out about recently: Mac’s Club.
</p>
<p>
 Mac’s Club is a gay bar in San Jose’s Qmunity District. It’s true, the entirety of the district is just half a block with a handful of places, but I think it’s very nice we have a gay and LGBT district/neighborhood here in general. I’ve been to Splash nightclub, which is right by Mac’s, a couple times. But, I have to be in a specific mood to dance at a club. I love that mood, but it’s not always. A place like Mac’s is much more my speed.
</p>
<p>
 After driving over and parking at an undisclosed location near downtown (it’s free and shall remain undisclosed), I started my small trek over. It was about a fifteen or twenty minute walk, but I really didn’t mind. Besides, it’s nice to walk around when people are out. And people were! I walked past The Ritz to dozens of people in glittery dresses and suits, clearly there was an event that I wasn’t privy to. I had some glitter on too, but that was for Mac’s.

<p>
 Eventually, I made it to Post Street and initially walked straight past Mac’s Club. It’s an unassuming place, but I’m guessing that it’s that way on purpose. I treaded back, and headed in.
</p>
<p>
 The first thought I had walking in was that the bar was quite thin. The bar and its seating covers the right half of it, while the left side lets you walk through and to the back. The skinnier feeling of the bar only led to it feeling slightly more intimate inside, something I quite liked throughout the night.
</p>
<p>
 Now I say I had nothing better to do on Friday, and it’s true. But also, I was itching to find some community, especially a queer one, here in the south bay. And as I sat down in Mac’s Club, I had brief flashbacks of being in Hillcrest in San Diego, where I spent many nights out while in college down there. Hillcrest is a large gayborhood, with so much life and community in every corner. I would love to write about it sometime in the future.
</p>
<p>
 Sat at the bar, I thought hard about a unique new drink to get. After straining my brain a bit too hard, I just decided to get a rum and coke. I made some conversation with the man sitting beside me, and he informed me about a drag show starting at Splash next door in less than half an hour. He said it might be more my speed, as a younger guy. I said I was here to come to Mac’s to relax and drink and just talk to some gays. He laughed.
</p>
<p>
 “You’re at the right place.”

 Mac’s is one of the oldest gay bars open in San Jose.
 <a href="https://www.ebar.com/story.php?ch=bartab&amp;id=233405">
  An article I found from the Bay Area Reporter
 </a>
 (good read by the way) notes that it was first listed in the San Jose city directory in 1963. But, it was undoubtedly open some years before that too. Gabriel, one of the bartenders, spoke to me briefly about the history of Mac’s. He mentioned to me that the current location of Mac’s had only been its home since the early 80s. That’s when the city had moved it from its previous location on 1st Street to Post Street some blocks away. I had actually unknowingly walked past it’s old location earlier in the night, it’s where the Continental Bar is presently, right next to the California Theatre.
</p>
<p>
 If you’ve been around 1st Street, you might also recognize it as being the street with whatever that massive modern art installation is. I refer of course to this:

 I have found out from the internet that this is called
 <a href="https://www.siliconvalley.com/2025/02/05/towering-art-installation-in-downtown-san-jose-finally-gets-a-new-purpose/">
  the Unzipped Gardens
 </a>
 and it’s a pop up roller rink. Right on, I’m already beginning to like it more. Kind of dope. Anyways, back to the point, Gabriel said Mac’s was moved due to some city citing zoning/building laws and that was that. But the city needed a gay bar, and San Jose has no Castro Street like SF. And so luckily, a
 <a href="https://www.queersiliconvalley.org/gail-macs/">
  wonderful new owner named Gail took over
 </a>
 and brought it to Post St for us. Thank you Gail.
</p>
<p>
 After finishing my drink and my chat with Gabriel - I decided to go to the back of the bar. I absolutely adore places that have an open air section, and while it wasn’t a fancy courtyard or anything - it was exactly what I was looking for. People enjoying the cold outdoors air and smoking with music softly permeating the air. There was also the classic dive bar bathroom stall; it didn’t close, there was no toilet paper, and the walls were littered in colorful graffiti and stickers. Great moody purple lighting in there though. I took a seat on a bench in the back and took it all in. Just the perfect spot to sit down and have a talk with some folks who were also looking for air.
</p>
<p>
 I had made a friend named Elle within minutes. They lived nearby in historic Naglee Park, and he was a new regular. We got along well, and we laughed and joked and mused about San Jose. I think I may have a friend and community from that connection alone. We shared a drink and a little green. People filtered in and out of our conversation and I was introduced to bartenders from Mac’s and other bars around downtown. Some served other dive bars, some fancier places. The bartender community sticks together regardless, clearly. And drinks together from what I could make out.
</p>
<p>
 I joined my newly made friend to a winebar around the corner and left Mac’s, but I knew I would be back later in the night. Wine isn’t particularly my thing, but we enjoyed a dry wine in a packed and somewhat bougier establishment than Mac’s. Later, I met a man named Enrico in the winebar, who was debuting his new Bent Dime Limoncello.
 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bentdimelemoncello/">
  I highly recommend you check it out
 </a>
 , it’s a slightly tangy sweet liqueur made with dried lemon skins, and Enrico was a great chat. I’d love to see his business do well and make it to grocery stores in California all the way from Bologna.
</p>
<p>
 I said goodbye to my new friend and to Enrico and walked back over to Mac’s, happily surprised to see the bouncer still remembered me after having only visited for the first time earlier that day. It was later in the night, and Mac’s had picked up quite a bit already. The bar was packed and I didn’t see an open spot, so I elected to head to the back again.
</p>
<p>
 Mac’s is primarily filled with queer gay men, but also any gay folk are welcome - I saw plenty of trans pride flags around. Everyone I talked to was incredibly welcoming. And again, in the back, I talked to some wonderful guys who were eager to tell me of the traditions of Mac’s and Renegades and the other bars in the area. I made note, and assured them I would join them for a trivia night, despite only having the knowledge of Beck’s discography and the names and heights of random mountains in the Himalayas to offer.

 By this point I needed to have a sit down, from all the walking and drinking. I went inside and found a barstool vacant. I sat down and sipped water and ate ice. Besides me was a woman named Jenny. She took to me quickly, and told me she had been a regular at Mac’s for about a quarter of a century, since she had always had many gay friends. I was in the presence of a local celebrity. She told me about how the bar had changed since it moved locations, but it had forever kept the welcoming gay and sometimes sensual atmosphere. She told me to come on weekends, when everyone was hugging and dancing and kissing. I imagine it does get slightly more dancey on those days. I was also attempting to sober up at this point, but I wasn’t there yet. So, I talked and talked about my troubles of finding community as of late, and of my dwindling number of friends. Of my troubles living at home sometimes. She assured me I would have no problem if I put my best foot forward. That’s what she had done twenty-five years ago. And she gave me a tight hug out the blue before I got up again.
</p>
<p>
 I left sometime after that, and walked to my car, and drove on home.
</p>
<p>
 About a week after, I had a spat at home with my parents and my sister. Emotions flared and temperatures rose. I was being accused of being too hidden with my own life, although expressed to me in uncouth ways. I found it important to have a talk with my sister alone at the end of that night. Between thoughts rushing out, I came out to her as bisexual in that moment. She was at a loss of words I think, and I had tears from everything that had already been said that night. But she assured me in how she responded that she had love for me. Through her minced words about how she wouldn’t tell our parents and that she always had an inkling. It meant the world to me to see her positive reaction, albeit expressed to me in a measured form. That’s just how it is between our family sometimes. But I had Jenny’s hug ringing in the back of me. I felt community with my sister then, but I also felt distant community through Mac’s then.
</p>
<p>
 Everyone needs a community. And for some, maybe that can be the Qmunity.

 This is something I want to make somewhat episodic on this substack (along with all the other writings). Posting about new bars I go to and discover, whether in a journalistic sense or casually writing something creative about them. I don’t want to simply review places; I want to experience them and write about my takeaways and my feelings of the night and the place.
</p>
<p>
 In jest, I’ve always said to friends that I love places that are divey and also kind of shitty. What I really mean is that I love a watering hole with some history and charm. Filled with old timers and regulars and bartenders who are all up for a chat. Basically, the exact opposite of whatever the Whole Foods bar in Sunnyvale is meant to be. And just generally way too fancy places where craft cocktails are too expensive? Again, I have to be in a specific mood. At the end of the day though - I just want to have a nice time in a cool spot and meet some kind people.
</p>
<p>
 There’s a couple that are already on my list of places I want to go to, ranging from being in the Santa Cruz mountains, to every neighborhood of San Jose and the other cities sprinkled around. One with a twist too, but I guess if you keep reading you’ll see what I mean. If you have recommendations of places you think I would enjoy and have unique history, please drop a comment! And as always, thanks for reading and see you next time.
