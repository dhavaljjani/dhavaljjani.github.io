 Santa Clara Valley. Silicon Valley. Valley of the Heart&rsquo;s Delight. Whatever you call it.
</p>
<p>
 Living in a valley is what we do as humans. They&rsquo;re vast, they have mild weather, and they&rsquo;re full of fertile soil. Water flows through the valley. Life flows through the valley.
</p>
<p>
 I enjoy getting up to the mountains around us, to look back at the valley we live in sometimes. Communications Hill, Black Mountain, Sanborn,
 &hellip; you can get stunning views from tons of places. My favorite might be Eagle Rock in Alum Rock Park. I may be biased since I live nearby, but I love running by the creek and hills there. And if you want to get to a view, you can do a small but steep hike up to the rock. You get a great view of the expanse that is San Jose, along with some tired legs. The hills are pretty year round, yes, but the view also reminds me of how much of San Jose is just houses.

 That&rsquo;s no accident. About 94% of San Jose is solely single family homes. And the rest of Santa Clara Valley generally builds very similarly. It was designed to sprawl and grow outwards like this, just like so many other western cities of the time. The early planners in San Jose literally aimed for it to be like LA. The goal was large networks of neighborhoods with detached homes and wide arterial roads, and everything in the way would be annexed.
</p>
<p>
 How did it happen this way, and what does this mean?
</p>
<p>
 Our cities and their people are forever shifting, but are largely shaped by their history. People desire some kind of lifestyle, and eventually, the cities of now reflect the desires of the past. In a way, the cities also end up reflecting the past hardships and triumphs of the people in it. Think about Detroit. An industrial city in the shadow of its success in an era long gone, where a new resurgence is only now underway. The population has similarly fallen and started to swell again.
</p>
<p>
 There are entire cities in China that were small port towns less than a hundred years ago; now they house towering glass skyscrapers and millions of people: due to the impressive growth in China.
</p>
<p>
 The places we live in change as we do as a people, and as we make different decisions. Duh, right?
</p>
<p>
 Similarly, the bay area and its cities also keep evolving around us. Think about San Francisco. San Francisco has gone through so many different eras; from an initial Spanish settlement, to a booming Gold Rush town, followed by the quick growth of the city in the 20th century, to the tech boom in the past twenty-five years. Today, it houses 808k people.
</p>
<p>
 Similar but different, San Jose has gone from being a Spanish settlement, to a stagecoach stop south of SF, to serving as the first capital of California (albeit for just a month), to the 10th most populous city in the country in 2016 with over a million people. That never felt right did it? I mean, look at the view in the picture above. Doesn&rsquo;t strike me as the tenth largest city in America.
</p>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s because the population density in San Jose is lower than a place like San Francisco (duh you say - I know).
 <a href="https://luminocity3d.org/WorldPopDen">
  Take a look at this website to really see it
 </a>
 ; it&rsquo;s a fun and pretty interesting way to visualize population density data around the world. Especially checking out other cities in the country as a comparison.
</p>
<p>
 The differences in density between SF and the majority of the rest of the bay leads to two distinct areas with two totally different experiences for their respective residents. In the past years,
 <a href="https://californiaglobe.com/fr/new-population-figures-show-bay-area-cities-continue-to-lose-residents-despite-touted-state-gains/">
  the population of San Jose has dropped below a million people and continues to slowly decline.
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 As a whole, although the bay area&rsquo;s population increased by a couple thousand, people in our region prefer to move out of the city, and into the suburban towns of the valley. Places with less population density. More single family houses. Places like Walnut Creek and Dublin are growing the fastest. Part of it is due to the enormous cost of living and housing in the bay&rsquo;s premier spots, which I&rsquo;ve touched on in this substack in the past. There are few other places in the country where the housing crisis is so apparent. The bay has always underbuilt housing, and has also always been an extremely desirable place to live in.
</p>
<p>
 These two facts are somewhat incompatible.
</p>
<p>
 So, with all these thoughts in mind&hellip; a group of tech-based Silicon Valley billionaires decided to take action to help solve our housing crisis. Selfless as they are (being facetious), they devised a plan to build a new utopian and futuristic city
 <em>
  currently
 </em>
 called &ldquo;California Forever&rdquo;. So today, I just want to see if it really is as altruistic of an idea as it seems at first glance, or if the billionaires are up to no good yet again. Is there even a need to build a new town, or should we focus on perhaps upzoning the places we already have?
</p>
<p>
 The city isn&rsquo;t planned to be very close to the south bay, but I see this development as very tied in with the story of the bay and its fate. It sort of serves as a litmus test for future similar ideas here. I have no clue what we&rsquo;ll take away, we&rsquo;re all learning about this together. Let&rsquo;s dive in.
</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>
 The group of investors behind &ldquo;California Forever&rdquo; were unknown for some time. It&rsquo;s spooky having mysterious groups of people buy large amounts of land in one area - especially near what is an active air force base in the Travis AFB. Over a billion was spent by the buyers,
 <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/mystery-company-buys-land-bay-area-base-18256224.php">
  and all of this caught the interest of local government officials and military alike.
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Finally, they were found out to be a group called the Flannery Associates. A group of very wealthy silicon valley elites. Many made their fortunes in finance and tech, I have no doubt. I didn&rsquo;t recognize any of the names part of the group, but here are some of them listed for you: Jan Sramek (founder of this venture), Reid Hoffman (Cofounder of LinkedIn), Michael Moritz (Welsh billionaire VC), Patrick Collison (CEO of Stripe). These people mean nothing to me.
</p>
<p>
 Since 2021, they have bought over 52,000 acres in the area, primarily swamp and farmland. For context, the location is not too far from the Suisun Bay and San Joaquin/Sacramento River&rsquo;s delta.

 In the little map above, you can see where it lies relative to the rest of the bay, and it&rsquo;s decently situated. It&rsquo;s pretty rural with no real connection to BART, but the Amtrak Capitol Corridor would serve it with stations at Suisun-Fairfield and Vacaville. Not completely terrible, but a bit of a drive.
</p>
<p>
 The end goal of &ldquo;California Forever&rdquo; of course, is to build their utopian city as part of Solano County, close to Rio Vista. Envisioned as a city of nearly 400k; it promises to be all mixed-use, have convenient and multimodal transit, provide over fifty thousand jobs, and prioritize walkable neighborhoods amidst new industrial and technological areas.

 ! Beautiful renderings, and lots of very amicable and positive quotes by Solano County residents and businesses alike. The focal point of the community would be a tremendous shipyard, an attempt to rouse the support of the government and Navy.
</p>
<p>
 The zoning map even includes a district (&ldquo;the maker and manufacturing&rdquo; space) meant to promote arts, culture, nightlife, etc. This is great to see, it&rsquo;s the type of thing that attracts young people to move in an area. I&rsquo;m not saying you
 <em>
  need
 </em>
 Main Street-esque areas filled with nightclubs (some of my favorite memories with friends are just jamming out in a car in the suburbs), but it absolutely doesn&rsquo;t hurt. Bring some festivals in, bring some culturally themed bars, and bring in the art.

 On the whole, there&rsquo;s not too much to dislike about this off the bat. There is the inherent mistrust of billionaires building things always (especially tech ones given the political climate), but I see no reason to immediately jump out to oppose this.
</p>
<p>
 What is not nice though, is the
 <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-forever-denies-tactics-bay-area-city-19365799.php">
  reports of residents in Solano County being lied to and hounded for signatures
 </a>
 , where they were not told what they were signing. That was to make it onto a county ballot, to pressure people into signing. Supposedly, they had pressured the landowners to sell the land in the first place as well.
</p>
<p>
 What&rsquo;s also not nice is the fact that it&rsquo;s almost entirely agricultural and swamp land, a huge environmental concern to try and develop. Will the land be stable? Will there be enough water?
</p>
<p>
 Building a new city and doing it with all the right intentions and plans is tough.
</p>
<p>
 Have you heard of California City? Located in the desert about an hour east of Bakersfield, and two hours north of Los Angeles; California City was a completely master-planned city as well. Envisioned as the newer (and better) Los Angeles, the city ended up&hellip; failing.

 Alright, you&rsquo;re right in that it seems harsh to consider the town a failure. Nearly fifteen thousand people do live there still. But, just like &ldquo;California Forever&rdquo; aims to now, it was meant to hold 400k. But the city failed to attract even a fraction of that amount of people - ultimately due to poor decision-making. The biggest issues were with having enough water (who could have seen that coming in a desert), and eventually the FTC filed a case on the developers for misleading advertisements. The biggest FTC settlement to date for the poor homeowners who bought into it.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;California Forever&rdquo; will have its work cut out in making sure they don&rsquo;t follow in the many missteps of California City. The key is slow growth. Support a hundred people sustainably and reliably. And then a thousand. And then ten thousand. You can&rsquo;t just shoot for 400 thousand on your first round.
</p>
<p>
 And of course, respect the land you build on. Respect the people of Solano County in building the town, instead of strong-arming them into support. That&rsquo;s the only way something like this could be a success.

 Have you ever seen
 <em>
  Vivarium
 </em>
 (2019)? I recently watched it, and while I&rsquo;m not sure I picked up on everything the movie hinted at, I definitely picked up some things relevant to all of this. I&rsquo;m going to be tossing aside the themes of no relevance to this post (as all good analysis does, I&rsquo;m sure).
</p>
<p>
 To sum it up, Vivarium is a horror movie featuring a young couple (played by Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots) who seek to buy a house. They meet a very peculiar real estate agent, who leads them to show them their new house in a new cookie-cutter development. One amongst many of the same: it&rsquo;s cold, indifferent, and impersonal.
</p>
<p>
 Except, the agent was never a real agent, the house was never a home, and their lives are irreversibly changed. They cannot escape (despite Jesse&rsquo;s incessant try-again attitude which leads to him literally digging his own grave), no one else is there, and they are forced to take care of an alien boy who comes in a box. Slowly, the couple begin to despise each other. Horror and psychological terrors ensue. Funky movie.

<p>
 What&rsquo;s the idea here though? I think part of the movie aims to address the perils of what is now a popular American life. I don&rsquo;t want to get too high-school-literature-class-analysis here but I probably will at least a bit.
</p>
<p>
 The kind of lifestyle idealized in our media is one born out of the dreams of the past. Things like capitalism, the nuclear family, and white picket fences have been ingrained in the American conscience (and consequently the global conscience) for like a hundred fuckin&rsquo; years. You should spend your life working to buy a large house and empty yard with neighbors that are far away, and maybe you&rsquo;ll be happy right? Don&rsquo;t worry about Willy Loman for even a second, you&rsquo;ve been promised the idea of becoming a JD Rockefeller.
</p>
<p>
 And so we encouraged developers to build large neighborhoods filled with detached houses and matching floor plans. Nothing inherently wrong about this, but it only inevitably leads to a loss of identity and a world of isolation.
</p>
<p>
 In
 <em>
  Vivarium
 </em>
 , the couple is young and wary, yet full of hope for their future. That&rsquo;s how I want myself, and humanity as a whole, to feel. I just hope we don&rsquo;t suffer the same fate as the characters in the movie. I&rsquo;m going to chalk the film up as a worst-case scenario.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 So instead of doing that, the idea of creating towns and neighborhoods with
 <em>
  multiple
 </em>
 mixed-use spaces is wonderful. But, zoning laws disallow this in many of our cities. Now, the idea of zoning absolutely makes sense (find me someone who thinks vape shops should exist next to daycares), but in another sense zoning can be oppressive because of how it can prevent organic types of growth.
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;ve been able to visit some major cities around the world in the past, and what they manage to do right is density. Even &ldquo;suburban&rdquo; areas can feel lively, safe, and be comfortable to live in. Many cities around the world build tall apartment towers,with plazas and stalls and life springing up around them. They have bus stops and communal spaces and schools in close proximity everywhere. From India to Brazil to Canada. It happens in Mumbai and Sau Paulo and Toronto. It&rsquo;s possible to do.
</p>
<p>
 Yet, this is the common kind of growth you see in San Jose and other cities in the bay:

 Do you see that desolate and fire hazard prone hillside there? The idea is to go out on Silver Creek Road and build a big ass neighborhood here (with zero parks, commercial, or office working spaces). Sounds great right?
</p>
<p>
 No. Sprawl is not nice. What&rsquo;s the point of having
 <a href="https://gisdata-csj.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/CSJ::urban-growth-boundary/explore?location=37.327652%2C-121.780566%2C10.53">
  urban growth boundaries
 </a>
 if we&rsquo;re just going to sprawl past them? The way I see it, sprawl is a last ditch solution to housing. Is the goal so that every human and their family can live as far away from one another as possible?
</p>
<p>
 I don&rsquo;t think humans are meant to live that way.
</p>
<p>
 Sure, I guess we probably have enough land area on the entirety of Earth to make that happen. Give every person an acre and a WiFi router with a roof - there&rsquo;s probably enough space to spare (Google says the Earth&rsquo;s land area is roughly 186 billion acres so we&rsquo;re totally good).
</p>
<p>
 But there&rsquo;s a reason people flock to cities and not to the boonies. Why is Barcelona a cultural center of the world, and not the middle of Antarctica? Because Barcelona was built for people to
 <em>
  live
 </em>
 in, rather than just a place with some people and research buildings.
</p>
<p>
 Look at San Francisco. It&rsquo;s so insanely expensive (to buy or rent really) but the population has barely dipped since COVID. New residential and office buildings are regularly approved and the city serves as the cultural and developmental center of the bay. It&rsquo;s not because of some unexplainable magic in the air; it has to do directly with the density and layout of the city.

 The craziest part of all this is, despite San Jose&rsquo;s lackluster planning and vision in the past, it&rsquo;s one of the few cities around us
 <em>
  actually trying
 </em>
 . Santa Clara and Sunnyvale are also trying. I was by the Levi&rsquo;s Stadium some weeks ago, surprised to see a new neighborhood with towering apartment buildings and new stores in the corners.

 Meanwhile, places like Palo Alto and Atherton
 <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/wealthy-bay-area-atherton-adus-low-income-housing-20361694.php">
  are squeezing past state housing requirements
 </a>
 by solely building ADUs for family members and passing them off as low income housing. That&rsquo;s their only form of upzoning. That&rsquo;s not good!
</p>
<p>
 Now, the reason why I write about development and housing is because I truly believe it impacts how we live
 <strong>
  every day
 </strong>
 . It&rsquo;s hard not to think about honestly.
</p>
<p>
 The biggest thing stopping density in our country, seems to me, to be the tedious rules and regulations meant to dissuade change - plus a large contingent of people who prefer being away from others. And they&rsquo;re loud. They&rsquo;re the ones participating in important conversations and council meetings. Urban planners and traffic engineers and civil engineers seem to generally believe in these ideas of walkable communities, and everything that would support making it happen in their towns. But, they find themselves to merely be pencil pushers beholden to the decision-makers who almost never share the same opinions.
</p>
<p>
 In this sense, the idea of creating a whole city is almost preferable. No opposition, no NIMBYs, no historical considerations to be made. Just build. Whatever you want. Build walkable neighborhoods instead of swaths of McMansions. Why not? That&rsquo;s what America&rsquo;s about, right?
</p>
<p>
 Build the intra-city transit, build the shipyard, and build the city. I tend to be idyllic, but I think we can be cautiously and warily optimistic. Let them try, I say. What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen? Some tech billionaire&rsquo;s investments go bad?
</p>
<p>
 Yeah, I don&rsquo;t really mind.

 I think this post may have meandered all over the place but it&rsquo;s encompassing a lot of thoughts I&rsquo;ve had recently. I hope it was at least somewhat enjoyable and informative to you, especially if you hadn&rsquo;t heard much about &ldquo;California Forever&rdquo; yet. I hope to get back to the creative writing soon.
</p>
<p>
 I missed the entirety of May; partly because a lot was happening in my personal life, and partly because I was just stuck in a writing rut. But I&rsquo;m back and I can&rsquo;t wait to be more consistent - hopefully sticking to a biweekly schedule.
</p>
<p>
 I have so many things planned for the future of this substack: stories from new hikes, stand-up shows I&rsquo;ve attended, more SJ Earthquakes talk, a visit to a miniature model train club, and possibly my first collaboration. Plus, SF Pride is coming up next weekend and I really hope to be there for it. I was at Mountain View Pride last week (the first one the city has ever held!) and I&rsquo;m debating writing about that as well. I also recently spent a few amazing days in Sequoia National Park and Badger, and I&rsquo;m debating whether or not to write about that, similar to the Humboldt post. It is quite far from the south bay though.
</p>
<p>
 If you have interest in any of these topics specifically, or just a thought about &ldquo;California Forever&rdquo; andthis post: please drop a comment!
</p>
<p>
 Happy Pride Month! Stay safe in between all the ICE raids happening. And, happy Bay Area Burger Week (yes that&rsquo;s a real thing).
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;ll see you soon.
