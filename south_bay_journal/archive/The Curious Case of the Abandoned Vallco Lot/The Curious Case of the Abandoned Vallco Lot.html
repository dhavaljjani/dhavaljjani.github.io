 Not so long ago when I was a kid, Vallco Shopping Mall was the place to be on weekends. With my family to go shopping or with friends, marveling at our newfound freedoms as we slowly got older. We’d mostly just muck around the stores, avoiding the department stores and seeking the food court and comic book stores instead. My friends and especially me, never had the money to get anything, but it was fun just being out. As we got older, we’d be at AMC for the big movies coming out every summer. We’d go walking from our elementary school to Portal Park to Vallco to anywhere else on Stevens Creek. And later, I even remember having my first “date” at Bowlmor Lanes too. I say date in quotes because I’m not sure if the other person was aware that it was a date for me.
</p>
<p>
 I’m sure everyone in this country had similar experiences with their local mall, especially in their hay days of the 80s and early 90s (I was not alive). But they were nice places to be. As the country and the cities and the towns everywhere shifted away from traditional downtowns and city centers, these areas became their replacements. Especially here in the South Bay. Hell, that’s the whole model of a place like the Great Mall and Valley Fair. A couple suburban parking lot malls that masquerade as town centers. At least Santana Row has multi-use apartments and people living in high density. I feel a recent shift has been about going away from suburban malls and big lots of department stores, and instead to pedestrianized downtown streets, but that shift seems slow, especially here in the South Bay.
</p>
<p>
 By the time I was in high school, the suburban American mall was already well on its way into the casket. It had been since the early 2000s.
 <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-life-and-death-of-the-suburban-american-mall">
  Slowly, vacant storefronts were everywhere and malls were dying across the country.
 </a>
 The reasons are plentiful. Online shopping websites took the main stage, and stores like Walmart, Target, and TJ Maxx were seen as the places to get the same things without having to go to a mall while also getting a discount instead. Increasing rents also meant more storefronts were empty, and who wants to walk through a half empty mall? Eerie liminal spaces where crimes were more feared since they served as suburban town squares, and these reasons compiled meant businesses didn’t want to be in malls soon. And the dead mall was born.
</p>
<p>
 Vallco was to be torn down. The side of it west of N Wolfe Road most specifically. In 2018, it began with a parking structure, and slowly other buildings were going down, until nothing was left on that lot. Around the same time, a friend of mine and I had become enamored with subreddits like /r/urbanexploration and by YouTube videos about exploring abandoned places. We took a newfound, and potentially not so legal, interest in Vallco. On three separate occasions, we took our small bags with a camera to run past the fences. We snuck in the to-be-demolished building, searching for picture-esque shots, and maybe something more. On two of the occasions we ran into security. Once, we practically walked into the security office that they had inexplicably open late at night. The other time, we tried to play off our presence as a lack of map comprehension, insisting we were lost and Google maps had led us astray. The security was stern, but I imagine they knew we were just some high schoolers messing around. Either way, the fences were pushed out a few days later. We learned of a new way to get in, through the back doors of the nearby ice rink. We went once more, but after that, nothing happened but demolition. We might have gotten asbestos poisoning there (joke,  I hope), but we did also end up getting some neat pictures to look back at. Shoutout to my friend for taking them. I didn’t include the photos with my dopey high school self, but here’s a small taste.

 Now, you’d think a wealthy city like Cupertino would have, in the following seven years, done something with such a large lot not far from the newly constructed Apple HQ along with their de-facto downtown in Main Street. Yet, the lot lies currently empty, only finally getting approval on a plan late in 2024. But even with that, I’ve realized that council approvals and development promises don’t necessarily mean anything in the long run.
</p>
<p>
 But first, let’s go over Vallco’s history and its timeline since the demolition. It was built in the 70s, and with improvements made all the way till the mid 90s. The largest department stores in it were Macy’s, Sears, and JCPenney’s. The Cupertino Ice Center was also an important part of the mall. And of course, AMC theaters were also a big draw, right by Sears! I still remember when Sears also began to share the space with the Bay Club, and then eventually it was just the Bay Club. And then we can’t forget the dozens of merchandise stores, clothing stores, jewelry spots, arcade rooms, and spots in the food court that made it most special. By the late 90s, the occupation rates were dropping until well into the 2000s. It was the emptiest mall in the area. Owners changed hands multiple times,
 <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/09/03/cupertino-square-owners-file-for-bankruptcy/">
  some went bankrupt,
 </a>
 and in 2014 the current owner purchased the mall for over $300 million.
</p>
<p>
 Now, the whole 50+ acre lot is owned by Sand Hill Property Corporation. They also operate the other side of Vallco which still remains, although just barely operational. Only the Bowlmor Lanes, Benihana, and the Cupertino Ice Center are left standing strong. These are all east of N Wolfe Road. The west side is now completely demolished, along with the pedestrian bridge over Wolfe.
</p>
<p>
 By just 2015, Sand Hill already planned to demolish the mall and instead proposed an ambitious development called “The Hill”. Now, take a look at one of their renders.

 Ridiculous. Cool, yes. But ridiculous as well. A massive pedestrian-friendly city center with buildings of apartments, shops, and restaurants all covered in rolling hills with park space on top of the building. Or hills? Whatever you’d call them. The largest green roof in the whole world. Very cool, but very clearly never something meant to really happen. Voters rejected this, of course they would given the costs.
</p>
<p>
 This is where Senator Scott Wiener comes in. He had introduced
 <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB35">
  SB-35, a bill to the California Senate.
 </a>
 The bill entailed a streamlined approval process for affordable housing in the state of California. Enacted in 2017, under governor Jerry Brown, it allows local governments and municipalities that are behind in meeting their housing quantity goals to cut corners in a sense. The approval time for the California Environmental Quality act was shortened for projects approved under SB-35, projects would require a hard percentage of the units being affordable according to local market rates, and developers would have to give unionized workers fair wages. All good ideas, me thinks. Many cities in the state disapproved of the bill of course, but adjustments were made, and it was passed. Locally, this bill is one of the ways so many affordable apartment projects have been approved and pursued in Mountain View and Sunnyvale as of late.
</p>
<p>
 Vallco is one of the biggest utilizers of this bill. In 2018, with SB-35,
 <a href="https://www.cupertino.gov/files/assets/city/v/2/departments/documents/community-development/planning/major-projects/the-rise/vallco-historical-project-information/archived-plans-and-technical-information/project-overview-and-reference-images.pdf">
  Vallco introduced another plan to the City of Cupertino, something they called the “Vallco Town Center”
 </a>
 . Looking through the archived proposed plan, it was a mixed-use downtown development with rezoning included, promising 2,402 residential units, over 400k square feet of retail and entertainment, and nearly 1.9 million square feet of office space. That, alone with a rooftop park, complete with jogging trails, playing fields, picnic areas…you name it and they promised it.
</p>
<p>
 The council approved this, and
 <a href="https://www.cupertino.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/departments/documents/community-development/planning/major-projects/the-rise/vallco-historical-project-information/vallco-specific-plan/vallco-specific-plan-proje_1.pdf">
  then repealed it some seven months after.
 </a>
 Why? The city referenced three separate voter petitions, one by the Friends of Better Cupertino nonprofit. Very friendly. Sand Hill gave up, and decided to start investing less into the mall, closing many stores by 2017.
 <a href="https://elestoque.org/2018/04/04/news/amc-cupertino-square-16-closes-doors/">
  The following year, AMC was closed as well.
 </a>
 In 2019, the Bay Club was the last tenant west of Wolfe to leave.
</p>
<p>
 The scaling of the project was changed by Sand Hill, height limits were set, densities were reduced, and in 2019 the city council adopted a new general plan for what they dubbed the Vallco Shopping District Special Area. Finally, you think. Sure, it’s not what was proposed, but something was adopted and approved.
</p>
<p>
 In 2020 and 2021, environmental concerns were brought up, and progress was halted again. This delay is understandable but still another chapter in the saga. Lawsuits built up. Again, the project was modified and submitted to the city in 2022. This was called The Rise.
 <a href="https://www.cupertino.gov/files/assets/city/v/1/departments/documents/community-development/planning/major-projects/the-rise/vallco-historical-project-information/the-rise-2022-modification-application/approval-letter.pdf">
  The Rise came with concessions
 </a>
 , the affordable below market rate housing units would be studios and one bedroom rather than various sizes, the units themselves would be smaller, and there would be less retail space by about 200k square feet.
</p>
<p>
 Yes, believe it or not, that needed modifications. In 2023, another set of modifications were submitted, and approved in February 2024. The Rise will be a multi-use apartment/retail/office city center, scaled back, but supposedly still happening. The city website has construction plans and renders in place, but construction, of course, is yet to begin.
</p>
<p>
 All this to say, I lost my head trying to make sense of this development while scouring the City of Cupertino’s project website and hundreds of documents of resolutions and approvals and repealings and lawsuits. You’d also think some bill like SB-35 was perfect for a development like this, but another assembly bill (AB1174 ) was needed to allow Vallco more time to begin construction making up for delays caused by all the aforementioned happenings. This project could have begun over five years ago, but nothing has happened yet.
</p>

<p>
 It’s not so surprising I guess. Cupertino is NIMBY land personified in a sense. I don’t mean that necessarily in a solely negative way, although the consequences do tend to manifest that way, especially for young people in the bay like myself. Development is just inherently opposed by the residents and the council, and that’s primarily why nothing had happened for years. Lawsuits, voters shooting down movements, and a general lack of enthusiasm for dense housing and commercial areas. Isn’t Main Street enough?
</p>
<p>
 And of course, owning housing in Cupertino (and the bay in general) is believed by many to be first and foremost an investment and asset, and then a place to live. People like their expensive homes, and they don’t like noise and density, as I brought up in
 <a href="https://dhavaljjani.substack.com/p/learning-about-the-vta-light-rail?r=2cslop">

 The south bay has already sprawled as far as it can up to the water and to the hills. Only upzoning the land could provide more housing units and cheaper housing/rents at this point, not solely building more SFH. We have built out the valley here so much, that the only solutions that remain are making this area more dense, or moving to places like Lodi, Morgan Hill, Santa Rosa, etc. I mean, I don’t know too much about the bay area housing market, but surely nothing showcases my point more than this screenshot of house prices in Mountain House, California:

 For context, Mountain House is a planned town that was only incorporated in July 2024. It is located about a 35 minute drive east of Pleasonton, closer to Tracy or Manteca. It only has a couple commercial areas, only recently getting a grocery store. Yet, it is a popular place for former bay area residents to buy a house and move, who commonly commute all the way to the South Bay, East Bay, and maybe even further to the city. And yet, forget affordable housing, the houses commonly cost upwards of 900k, look at the map in the screenshot. That’s just crazy.
</p>
<p>
 To me, upzoning the land in the bay as of now makes far more sense for the population, rather than building exurbs further and further out. We simply need more density.
</p>
<p>
 Recently, our favorite Senator Wiener (you have no idea how hard it is for me to remain mature) introduced a new bill that I see somewhat relevant to all of this. I’m referring to SB-79, which aims to address transit-oriented development along with upzoning in general. Simply put, the goal of the proposed bill is to allow more dense housing (rather than solely single family housing) near rail and bus corridors (within a half a mile). In the bay, we have a good presence of transit, between the BART, Caltrain, VTA, Ace Train, etc. If we can build the areas around them up more, we can not only form new vibrant neighborhoods that prioritize pedestrians, but also bring housing/rent costs down in general. An easy slam dunk if you ask me.
 <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/support-legislation-to-expand-transit-oriented-development/?source=bill-page">
  Sign the petition for it if you agree

 , to help signal to our state senate that this is a good idea.

 Hope you enjoyed this, and maybe picked something up about the epic Vallco saga that continues to delight and drag on. Maybe one day, Cupertino’s council, the residents of the city, the owners of the lot, and the developers will finally come to a resolution and something is built. Maybe “The Rise” (2024 approved) truly is the one. I wouldn’t hold my breath though.
