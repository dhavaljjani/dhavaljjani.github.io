 This one’s a follow up to the post from some weeks ago which was primarily about looking to the past of San Jose Earthquakes' ex-players and icons. This time, we’re going to talk about the upcoming season, San Jose’s offseason moves, and the many storylines going into the season, which starts in a few day’s time. Also, for those who don’t follow the team, maybe it can serve as a small guide. I can’t claim to know everything about the Earthquakes, but I’ve definitely sunk too much in following them for nearly the past decade.
</p>
<p>
 Last season was a typical Earthquakes season by the end. Pretty much a few starters injured at any given moment, losing in blowouts both home and away, and getting knocked out of the Open Cup by a USL team. At least we
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_spoon_(award)#Major_League_Soccer">
  won a record breaking fifth wooden spoon.
 </a>
 I’d say it was disappointing, but this is about what we’ve grown to expect from the team. The only good moments I can recall from the 2024 season are the 3-1 win we had against LAFC at Levi’s, when there was still some hope for playoffs. The other was when we smashed Necaxa 5-0 in the Leagues Cup Round of 32, and promptly got knocked out in the next round. We had some other wins, and PayPal Park is always an incredibly fun place to be at, but generally… just another season to forget.
</p>
<p>
 Being a fan of a losing team can be romantic in a sense, you grow jaded but also fall in love with your team of miscreants. Every week they put in another terrible shift but, for a moment, you thought they might pull off something special. Those special moments. That feeling keeps you coming back over and over again, in love with the idea of something more next week.

 But when it ends, it’s just over. And our season ended with a loss and we moved on to the postseason. But boy, have we had a postseason. We’ve had a slew of action in the form of players heading in and out of the South Bay. I try and be optimistic before every season - but we might have something to actually back it up with this year. Let’s go over why this season
 <em>
  may
 </em>
 be the start of a new era.
</p>
<h1>
 The Big Changes
</h1>
<p>
 Luchi Gonzalez is no longer our coach. He was fired because we were abysmal under him (honestly not totally his fault). However, Luchi is still at the club! He’s the new Academy Director for the club which seems like a role that suits him much better. He’s done some great work with youth players in Dallas, and I see no reason why he couldn’t do great with us here. We need more homegrown players, plus now we still get to see Luchi at games, rocking his snazzy turtlenecks as always. Win win.
</p>
<p>
 We have a new coach of course, and it is none other than former USMNT coach Bruce Arena. Bruce Arena coached the US national team to three separate continental Gold Cup titles, along with one of our best ever performances at a World Cup - making it to the quarterfinals in 2006 and narrowly losing 1-0 to a strong Germany. At the club level, Arena has won the MLS Cup five times, the Supporter’s Shield five times, and been awarded MLS Coach of the Year four times. He’s won with DC United, the New England Revolution, and especially with our SoCal rivals, the LA Galaxy. But, I’m willing to put his previous allegiance to the Galaxy past him. His earliest MLS title is marked by an MLS Cup win with DC United back in 1996, and his latest is a Supporter’s Shield win with the New England Revolution in 2021. That’s over twenty years of experience at a high level and in and around the league. Bruce may be the most tried, tested, and subsequently accomplished coach the Earthquakes have had.
</p>
<p>
 It’s also important to consider this coaching change as fairly as we can. Bruce Arena, while having a spectacular resumé, finds his way to San Jose for a reason. He was let go by the New England Revolution in 2023 due to “an ongoing investigation being conducted by Major League Soccer into allegations of insensitive and inappropriate remarks”.
 <a href="https://www.thenutmegnews.com/current/2023/12/13/bruce-arena-ready-to-put-whatever-it-is-that-he-actually-did-behind-him">
  It’s still not clear what he did
 </a>
 , but that’s definitely slightly odd and off putting. And we know of situations like that in San Jose all too well, ever since a NY Red Bulls player had been suspended in 2023 when he allegedly racially abused Jeremy Ebobisse during a game.
</p>
<p>
 Regardless, Arena left the New England Revolution, and has been out of MLS action since. Luckily for us, he seemingly still has a strong connection with the Revolution and their roster, since we have had numerous transfers between the two clubs this off season. Let’s go over some of the transfers we made.
</p>
<p>
 As mentioned in the last Earthquakes post, right-back Nick Lima has come back to play for San Jose from the Revolution. Along with him we’ve brought in some of his New England teammates too. The include the two midfielders Ian Harkes and Mark-Anthony Kaye, along with central defender Dave Romney. Harkes and Romney strike me as great utility players for the squad each with a wealth of experience in MLS. I expect the Canadian Mark-Anthony Kaye to play a bigger role in our team, and would not be surprised to see him starting.
</p>
<p>
 The transfer season started off pretty tamely. It seemed inevitable that we would say goodbye to striker Jeremy Ebobisse and he did leave, to LAFC of all places. But he was a wonderful asset to the team for years, and rose to the third highest goal scorer of all time for the Earthquakes, with 38 goals for us. A ways away from Wondo at 171, but still an incredibly solid player who brought so much energy on and off the pitch for us.
</p>
<p>
 Our former captain, Jackson Yueill, was also traded to the New England Revolution for free. He was a great presence for us in the midfield, especially in his earlier years, and grew into a leadership role very well. I always felt like he regressed after he had had been called up to the national team, but regardless he brought us some good memories and goals and I’m sad to see the back of him.
</p>
<p>
 Another big loss (at least to me), was the departure of homegrown player Tommy Thompson. Tommy has been at the club since he was fifteen years old. And in the last decade, he’s proved himself to be such an incredibly hard working player - putting in shifts at positions where he’s needed. He transitioned from being a winger, into playing in the central midfield, into being an attacking right back for us. He would bomb down the wings sometimes which was always a delight to watch. At the start of his career Tommy would also juggle and freestyle during half time as a sort of performance, and would give every kid at games high fives afterwards. When Matias Almeyda became our head coach in 2018, he learned Spanish to communicate with the new coach and the rest of the Spanish-speaking players on the team. I’ve seen him stick around at games to appreciate the fans and take photos…all this to say that Tommy is an exemplary San Jose player. He’s the type of player that fans grow to love, and I hope he’s able to find a team in the offseason, as a free agent.
</p>
<p>
 Backup goalkeeper JT Marcinkowski left to the Galaxy, and young goalkeeper Emi Ochoa was sold to Cruz Azul for a whopping $2 million. One of our designated players, Carlos Gruezo, also left to a team in his home country of Ecuador, but the writing was on the wall for quite some time about his departure. At least we opened up a DP spot! Every MLS team is afforded three “Designated Players” whose wages are allowed to break the salary cap for a single player. Teams often sign their biggest players and names as DP players, commonly in attacking positions.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the last player to leave was Tanner Beason, who also went to the other side of the coast to New England. Tanner was honestly never a great defender for us, so I didn’t mind that at all either.
</p>
<p>
 Now, what did the Earthquakes do with a new DP spot? We signed former LAFC and RSL striker Cristian Arango, who has been red hot in the past few years. This was a hugely exciting move by us, and I think it shows ambition that the team has lacked as of late. Cristian Arango, nicknamed Chicho, is coming into his fifth MLS season, three with LAFC and two with RSL. With LA, Arango won the MLS Cup and Supporter’s Shield while scoring over 40 goals over two seasons. At RSL, he fared just as well, with 26 goals in thirty appearances for them, and commonly coming in clutch with late goals. He’s a proven goal scorer, and he’s said he
 <a href="https://x.com/tombogert/status/1879874853425070381">
  was looking for a fresh new start
 </a>
 . I hope San Jose provides him with that, and we see him scoring, especially in the first game of the season against his former team Real Salt Lake.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the cherry on top of our offseason was the signing of MLS royalty, the Venezuelan striker Josef Martinez. If you’ve followed MLS, you would have heard of Josef’s name. He is seventh in the all time MLS scoring records, and famously won the golden boot in 2018 with 31 goals, which made him the 2018 MLS season MVP. He topped that year off with a great performance in the final which won Atlanta United the MLS, and him the MLS Cup MVP. Since that season, Josef continued to score at freakish levels until he fell out of favor at Atlanta circa 2022. He went to Miami and scored consistently for them, and last season he found himself north of the border in Montreal. He helped muscle CF Montreal into playoffs, and regularly scored towards the second half of the season. He came to San Jose as a free agent, but I think it was a smart decision by San Jose to pick him up. It’s true, it is no longer 2018 and Josef is not as nimble and lethal as he used to be in MLS. But clearly, he can serve as a more than solid striker at this level, and he and Arango will be trouble for so many defenses.
</p>
<p>
 Overall, I’d give our transfer window an 8.0 on the Richter scale. We majorly shook things up in our attack and bolstered our coaching staff (I promise that’s the last earthquakes pun I’ll make). It’s not quite a ten for me because we did little to improve our backline - which had
 <em>
  numerous
 </em>
 problems last season. I can think of at least 78 problems - oh wait that’s just the amount of goals we conceded last year! A league worst. Anyways, let’s take a look at how the team might shape up during the season with all the new signings slotted in.
</p>
<h1>
 A Prospective Lineup
</h1>
<p>
 In the preseason we’ve rolled out all kinds of lineups, testing out new combinations and formations. We have lost three out of the four preseason matches. Now preseason games should never matter for the result, but the fact that we lost one of them in 1-5 in classic San Jose fashion was slightly worrying. We played with three defencers at the back during preseason, trying to fit in all our new attacking puzzle pieces, but I think that’s an experiment that should end. My high school team tried three at the back once too and the less said about that rainy day at Wilcox High School, the better. We should play four at the back, and run with a single striker being supplied by Hernan behind him and a couple wingers to his side.
</p>
<p>
 Here’s an approximate depth chart made by me of our starting lineup:
</p>

<p>
 What I’m most excited for this season is to see Espinoza whipping in perfect passes and crosses as he’s been known to do, but with Josef and Chicho to finally have the quality to finish them off. Espinoza has been tirelessly our most productive and overall best player for the past three or four seasons, and it’ll be so nice to see him have support in thr attack for once. As Hernan settles after his arrival mid season last year, and the new players get comfortable; I think this could be one of the most electric MLS attacks in the league.
</p>
<p>
 As I mentioned, our depth in the midfield and attack looks fabulous…but the defense is largely unchanged in terms of starters other than Lima. Bruno Wilson will be back after his long injury and well rested after the offseason, so I’m hoping he’s able to find good form. Daniel saved us from embarrassment repeatedly last year, and was one of the best shot stoppers in the league. I hope we put him in those positions to have to make those saves less often though.

 On the 16th, about a week before the season opener, the Quakes held a kickoff party at San Pedro Social in downtown. It was an opportunity to meet some players, get some merch and knick knacks, and hang out with Quakes fans while a DJ played some type of clubby mariachi fusion. I was nursing a beer and debating getting in the awfully long line to meet some players when I ran into (now retired) Quakes legend and club assists leader Shea Salinas. He was just walking around, helping the event run smoothly. He still works at the club and coaches youth squads as I found out. Weirdly, I found him easiest to talk to out of everyone I did that day, but I think that says more about my (sometimes) lacking social skills. I love sports so much, but I find it hard to fit in with sports guys and that archetype sometimes. But, Shea was a great chat and made me remember why I love this team. The players are always hospitable, the fans range from sports bros to locals who just love the city.
</p>
<p>
 Anyways, also present at the event (behind the extremely long line that I never joined), were Josef Martinez, Chicho Arango, and Bruno Wilson. Ultimately, I think how these three players perform will make or break our season. They seemed in good spirits, and I loved seeing them interacting with all the fans and laughing with all the kids that had shown up. All round, some great energy! Afterwards, I took my newfound energy to my favorite new spot in DTSJ, Mac’s Club, and nearly fell asleep at the bar fantasizing of seeing this image more during the season:

 The Earthquakes have a lot of momentum going into this season for once, and I hope it does live up as a memorable one. And if not, there’s always LOBINA (the longest outdoor bar in North America™) to go and grab a drink by. I’ll see you soon though - thanks for reading!

 I’m not sure when the next post about the Earthquakes will be, but I think I’ll wait at least some matchdays and maybe even some months to let myself ruminate on thoughts about the team, and of course to write about all the other stuff I have planned. I may yet decide to write about the opening day game and the atmosphere and the food this Saturday at PayPal Park, as I will be there. I don’t go to most home games, but I’ll be watching every game. If you have T-Mobile,
