 When I moved into my first apartment outside a college campus - I needed a couch.
</p>
<p>
 I needed a better chair to sit on. I also needed a light. The lights had yet to turn on - I had accidentally requested the service be activated by SDGE a day
 <em>
  after
 </em>
 I moved in.
</p>
<p>
 The apartment was cold and empty otherwise. My stuff was pushed up to the wall on one side of the smaller bedroom, alongside a twin bed. I was only going to be sharing that room of the two, but I was the first to move in.
</p>
<p>
 I locked the doors for the first time. I checked Apple Maps to see where the closest store was. I needed to find a lantern or a candle or some form of light. It was getting dark quick.
</p>
<p>
 High as a kite, I began wandering around my new neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
 The Vons nearby was closed. I doubt it would have done me much good either way.  I was in Ralph&rsquo;s instead. I had walked over the damn interstate to get to this shopping plaza, it better be worth it I thought.
</p>
<p>
 The aisles were empty. Not many people were shopping around by now. I found a corner with small devices and lights, and my eyes struck a small battery-powered light. You press it and it turns on. All I need. The two batteries in the back were no-name. I didn&rsquo;t care. I bought a couple other things. I could, it was just me. Now, another thirty minute walk into the cool night.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 The space was nice. I was calling my parents every couple days, but aside from that I felt like I had breathing room.
</p>
<p>
 We had settled into a nice rhythm. Mornings of Mario Kart Wii, and nights of&hellip;well Mario Kart Wii. I would be late to my lecture for &ldquo;The Solid and Fluid Earth&rdquo; time and time again, because I was busy collecting data for the Mario Kart spreadsheet. The Foodworx Fest, we called it. Still going on. Wouldn&rsquo;t have traded it for anything.
</p>
<p>
 We would slack on the dishes sometimes. Sometimes, we were up too late for the third roommate. Growing pains, right?
</p>
<p>
 I was hungry, and it was late. It had been drizzling earlier. I wandered out the room like a zombie, and spotted my friend cooking something up.
</p>
<p>
 We talked about our days and our situations. We talked about music and love and philosophy. We talked about last night. An impression of the current president. That was a bad impression but good character. We&rsquo;ll keep that.
</p>
<p>
 I took a seat on the couch. It smelled great. I was still hungry, but I&rsquo;m sure I could grab a bite off of whatever my friend was cooking.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 It was pouring by now. When I was indoors it was fine. That was less than an hour ago. Just my luck today.
</p>
<p>
 Office hours had been a mess. My raytracer was so close but I knew something was off. I just couldn&rsquo;t figure out why. My concepts were fine. But the TA could hardly help. He had no interest in going through hundreds of lines of code for something mildly wrong. We had already achieved a passing grade, he said. I said we, but my lab partner may have taken even less of an interest in the lab than our TA.
</p>
<p>
 I shook my head, and my body shuddered. It was past me, and I prepared to run into the rain. I wanted to make this damn bus. The 202, it was so reliable. Never a minute late. Not like the 140.
</p>
<p>
 My laptop and books juggled in my bag as I ran. I was wet, but my sweater was black. Who could even tell. Campus was empty today. I went to the further station, confident a bus would be waiting.
</p>
<p>
 I ran past my old apartment in transfer housing where I had been over a year. So many friends younger and older. I ran past the small table I had had my first kiss with my first boyfriend. I ran past where I had lost my mind by a cactus for the first time. I ran past where I found it, too.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the Gilman bus station. I shuffled into the bus, headphones on and brain paused.
</p>
<p>
 I had made it to the &ldquo;peanut&rdquo;, as my roommates and friends had begun to call it. Look at it on a map, and you&rsquo;d get it. I went past the Vons. Past the imposing Mormon Church. Past the wolf that was really a bench. Past the grassy field. Below the interstate. What was home.
</p>
<p>
 I was getting too romantic in my head. I had things to do. I scampered in, tossing my stuff around. And my wet sweater in the laundry. I changed quickly, and ate some wheat thins. Hit the right spot. I picked out my new jacket (equally unresistant to water), and went out the door.
</p>
<p>
 An hour later. Let&rsquo;s say two. I was buzzed. My intramural soccer team was celebrating. Celebrating what? I don&rsquo;t know. We had lost every game. That was an achievement in its own right to be fair. I was telling our goalie that the Salton Sea was completely man made. How bizarre! They didn&rsquo;t share my excitement.
</p>
<p>
 I remember the walk home in the arms and embrace of my friend. I don&rsquo;t even know if we did. That&rsquo;s just what I remember.
</p>
<p>
 We were lost in conversation as I sat on the couch and opened my computer again. It still wasn&rsquo;t working. I stared at some of my code, and promptly decided to forget about it. That was for another day.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m fairly certain the whole point of BS is that there are no rules. That&rsquo;s the whole card game. My friends disagreed, I had cheated supposedly. It was all in fun though. We were laughing and drinking and laughing some more. They wouldn&rsquo;t let me hear the end of it. I&rsquo;ll finish my drink then.
</p>
<p>
 It was nearing 1 AM at Hennessey&rsquo;s. Not the latest we had been there, not even close. The bartender was telling us about how the city had changed. Especially La Jolla. I&rsquo;m sure it had, but I just wanted to see the seals and sea lions.
</p>
<p>
 La Jolla cove gets in a cool haze late at night in fall. The fog was gone and so were most the people. Not the seals though.
</p>
<p>
 The seals on the beach and in the water were raucous as ever. They seemed to be having a battle for who could be loudest with the cormorant birds perched on the cliff. The seals were winning this one for me.
</p>
<p>
 I fell off the cliff once, I remembered. A little down the coast. I chuckled. I&rsquo;m so lucky I&rsquo;m fine. It couldn't go wrong tonight though, I was with my friends who had helped me out that night. All was good.
</p>
<p>
 We were stood on the stairs looking out into the Pacific. So many times we had conversations about how vast the Pacific Ocean is. Thousands of miles without any land.
</p>
<p>
 The seals were still yelling. We&rsquo;d go minutes without talking, just listening to the life and crashing of waves around us. There&rsquo;s really nothing like it. Hazy midnight skies, warm alcohol lining my stomach, and friends with whom I felt like more than the wallflower.
</p>
<p>
 An hour later, there was no room on the couch. The ottoman would have to suffice. I crawled around, watching the projector screen flicker with games everyone was playing. Everyone was here.
</p>
<p>
 Safe and sound, I crashed on the living room couch again that night. We had a new one, and we had dragged it across the park ourselves. I sprawled out on it. I felt like those warm seals.

<p>
 Another day of carefully organizing computer cables and dodging students on a golf cart. I was done. Kele Okereke&rsquo;s voice hung in my head as I dodged more people on campus. I loved walking around campus normally, but today I was tired. Not sure how I had managed to stay awake in the first few hours of work. Briefly, it felt like I was walking the lawn back at the Merced campus. Oh, I was tired.
</p>
<p>
 I got on the bus, put my bag beside me, and kicked my feet up. My brain was turned off. The bus stopped at Nobel Station. I got some fries and a falafel wrap to fuel me. Back on the bus, soon I arrived at the peanut. Off the bus, I started home thinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m definitely not going for a run today.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 As I got to my apartment, I met eyes with a couple in a van. The guy saw me too and complimented my headphones. I started about how I had received them for free actually. He nodded, and asked if I wanted to hang out and take a hit with them.
</p>
<p>
 Shit, he just had to ask. I had never used a dab rig before, but I prided myself on being an open minded guy. His girlfriend took a hit and started conversation with me. Then me. My throat burned. I played it cool, but my words lost me. I said bye to my friends after a short conversation.
</p>
<p>
 I was coughing and I barely chucked my stuff on my room&rsquo;s ground before I lied down on the couch. For about a minute I just coughed harder and harder.
</p>
<p>
 Suddenly, it stopped and I was in bliss.
</p>
<p>
 Summer was going on forever. I had stayed in San Diego instead of going back home in the bay to work full-time on campus. Some money and a kickstart to my career, I hoped. It had been a very tiring day of work but nonetheless it had been a good day, I reflected. The tiring days are always the ones you look back at.
</p>
<p>
 It was a good summer.
</p>
<p>
 By now, it was already 7 PM. I had promised my love that we would be going to Hillcrest. One of our favorite spots in the city. PB was nice, but Hillcrest was diverse and gay. I appreciated that.
</p>
<p>
 We would meet every day at 3:20 PM. We called it the 3:20 spot. We&rsquo;d meet by the sixth college there between classes or other things sometimes. Sometimes it was the start of the rest of our day together.
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes I was really tired. Sometimes, she was bouncing-off-the-walls energetic. Sometimes, she was grumpy. Sometimes, we both needed to talk and get something off. Sometimes, we just needed to sit in silence together.
</p>
<p>
 It was unlike all the people in the past. We had grown past our problems for once. Past me being a shit partner. Past her too. We had failed each other some times before but no longer. We were succeeding. We were&hellip; going to Hillcrest.
</p>
<p>
 Fuck! It was 9 PM now. Lying on the couch, I had one hand in a box of wheat thins and another on my laptop. My eyes glossed over my computer, and the image I had rendered looked back at me. A rainbow plane had rendered and it was flying in the black void of space. The raytracer was working, yes, but so was the script that would let it render and process object files. A whole world had been unlocked now. I could make any
 <em>
  thing
 </em>
 appear.
</p>
<p>
 Delighted, I got up and put on the nicest jacket I could find. My nails looked nice. It was time to meet Hillcrest&rsquo;s finest gays, lesbians, and transsexuals. Including my love. And me.
</p>

<p>
 Return the key. Find my charger. Empty my desk. Sell the couch.
</p>
<p>
 Return the key. Find my charger. Empty my desk. Sell the couch.
</p>
<p>
 This was what was running through my mind as I threw out another trash can. The last few things left to do for moving out. I was emptying out my apartment.
</p>
<p>
 I had already lost my shoes thanks to my negligence. I had put them in garbage bags, besides the
 <em>
  <strong>
   real
  </strong>
 </em>
 garbage bags filled with trash. So it&rsquo;s no surprise I ended up tossing all the shoes and cleats and sneakers with them. One of the garbage truck drivers said it was too late, and the truck was probably already on route to its next stop before the landfill.
</p>
<p>
 The couch wasn't selling either. No one online seemed to want it. Just toss the thing, I thought, finally. I really sh- Shit I see the charger. One thing down.
</p>
<p>
 Return the key. Empty my desk. And sell the couch.
</p>
<p>
 I looked at my desk. Most the work had already been done by past-me yesterday. Good on him, I&rsquo;m too harsh on that guy. There was still a drawer to clear up though.
</p>
<p>
 Receipts, papers, rubber bands, trinkets, pencils, dead carts, stickers, there was too much shit. I&rsquo;m sentimental to fault sometimes so I went through each item twice. Some stuff was just trash. Some stuff was everything. Again, I can be happily sentimental.
</p>
<p>
 My hats were hiding below the desk too. I threw them all in a bag, but paused at the Loyal hat. They were the soccer team in the USL that had folded this year. I had been at the last game. I put my hat on.
</p>
<p>
 Another task down. Now to return the key. This one would be a breeze.
</p>
<p>
 Wrong. It was already 2 PM. The ladies at the front office had made it clear that the office closed at noon. Why they didn't have a key drop-off I don&rsquo;t know. Why they were only open to noon I don&rsquo;t know. All I knew was that by the time it opened tomorrow, I would be across the state.
</p>
<p>
 I had my keys, and my roommate&rsquo;s to return.
</p>
<p>
 Our upstairs neighbors. A couple and their young son. We had seen them in passing, and hadn&rsquo;t gone past &ldquo;hi&rdquo; yet. Nearly a year and a half at this apartment, and that&rsquo;s how far we got. Goes to show how living in and off campus differed. Maybe it had been a lack of effort on our part too. The door across us was a show apartment. Not lively.
</p>
<p>
 I ran upstairs, knocked, and introduced myself for the first time to the guy who lived there, the dad of the family. He congratulated me on my graduation. We started chatting, and he seemed a nice man. Maybe in another life, I would have talked to him earlier. He obliged to do me a favor and return mine and my roommates keys in the morning.
</p>
<p>
 Hero. He&rsquo;s folklore for me now.
</p>
<p>
 And now all my stuff was more or less done and packed. I thanked my new and old friend, and went back downstairs. I took my hat and headphones off, wanting to hear the real world. I was exhausted, and I laid flat out on the couch content with my effort.
</p>
<p>
 Sell the couch.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Now, I often sit alone on my bed with things clawing at my brains. Things
 <em>
  I have
 </em>
 to get to. Things I
 <em>
  have
 </em>
 to do. Things
 <em>
  one must
 </em>
 do. Things my career and life
 <em>
  needs
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 I miss my life in San Diego. I used to look forward to nothing more than getting to sit on that couch after a long day.
