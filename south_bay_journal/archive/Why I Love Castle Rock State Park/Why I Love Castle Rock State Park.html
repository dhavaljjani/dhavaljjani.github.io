 “You’re a long walk from Sanborn yet I’ll tell you that.”
</p>
<p>
 Not the words you want to hear when the sun is getting ready to set and you have no clue how far from your parked car you are. Happens to me all too often. I thanked the ranger and pondered the maps I have, confused as to how I had gotten lost despite having four of them. Maps are meant to be
 <em>
  my thing
 </em>
 too.
</p>
<p>
 The sun was setting to the left, and it hinted towards one thing at least. The trail was headed northward. Sunlight was flickering in between the branches of the trees, and it was threatening to send me into a sleepy trance. I shook my head to snap out of it, and looked at the dirt trail and mountains ahead of me again with wide eyes. They’d be dark soon. I didn't need my lantern just yet, but I needed to
 <strong>
  get going
 </strong>
 .

 Hiking in the mountains is the premier local getaway. It feels remote but still close enough to be familiar. Sometimes in the mornings I see the fog spilling over the ridges of the mountains, as if they’re teasing me to come visit. At least that’s how I feel when I see them as I’m groggily going to work instead.
</p>
<p>
 Whether you’re on 280 or the Caltrain though, the Santa Cruz Mountains are a constant in the view from SJ to the rest of the peninsula. Considered a part of the larger Coastal Range of California, these mountains span from a little south of Daly City and South City all the way down to Monterey Bay. Unlike the Diablo Range to the east of our valley though, these mountains are luscious and green and thickly forested. They stand at nearly four thousand feet high, and you may recognize some of the notable peaks like Mt Bielawski, Loma Prieta, and Mt Umunhum. Their impressive local prominence means that the Santa Cruz mountains more or less dictate the climate of our valley too.
</p>
<p>
 They’re a great example of the rain shadow effect. Wet winds flow north-east into the mountains from the Pacific Ocean in the west. The cool air rises above the mountains and by the time it descends on the other side, it’s dry and heavy. What lies on this other side is our valley. As a result, San Jose and its surrounding cities receive
 <strong>
  way
 </strong>
 less rainfall than anything on the ridge or ocean-facing side of the mountains. Boulder Creek in the Santa Cruz Mountains averages roughly 40 inches of rainfall a year, whereas San Jose averages roughly 14 inches of rainfall. That’s an average of course, I mean there was pretty much no rain between 2010 and 2017.

   Made this map to show the average rainfall levels in the Santa Cruz mountains and our valley. Interestingly, it also looks very very similar to an elevation map of the area. Higher places receive more rain, go figure.

<p>
 What this also means is that the eastern side of San Jose gets pretty warm. Most of the cities of the bay either lie on the foothills of the mountains (Cupertino, Saratoga, Los Altos), by the bay itself (Redwood City, Oakland), or between both (Palo Alto, Mountain View). So, inland south and east San Jose collect all the hot air while the mountains and adjacent towns receive the cool and misty air. It’s part of why it’s so expensive to live here. The geography around us dictates a lot of our reality.
</p>
<p>
 All the cool air and rain and fog does mean that the mountains themselves are lush with life though. There’s towering redwoods, doe-eyed deer, and very-good-at-hiding mountain lions. There’s also rattlesnakes, salamanders, songbirds, lichen, poison ivy
 <em>
  and
 </em>
 poison oak, it just goes on and on. I’m not much of a bird watcher, but I’ve heard from multiple bird-watchers that Henry Cowell State Park (near Santa Cruz) is wonderful for hearing calls and spotting birds.
</p>
<p>
 Henry Cowell is one of many parks in the mountains. By my count, there are 26 open space preserves, over 40 county parks (between Santa Clara County, Santa Cruz County, and San Mateo County), 9 state parks, and 8 state beaches to boot. And if you’re going to one of the state parks or beaches,
 <a href="https://www.parks.ca.gov/30806">
  you can checkout a vehicle day pass from any local library
 </a>
 and skip the fees to get in. Save yourself the seven bucks.
</p>
<p>
 On this day, pass in hand, I was headed to Castle Rock State Park. I had been a few times before, but today was going to be slightly different.
</p>
<p>
 Before I was scrambling to get to my car in the evening, I had parked at Sanborn County Park at noon. Sanborn’s a great place to have a picnic, to camp, or to hike. I wanted to make it to Goat Rock in Castle Rock, an adjacent park. Goat Rock’s a (a high point and picturesque sandstone formation) It’s a popular destination for climbers and people seeking a view alike. It’s
 <strong>
  the
 </strong>
 castle rock the park is named after.
</p>
<p>
 There are a couple different ways to get there. Get there early before parking fills up, and anyone can drive up to the parking lot nearby and hike on over, maybe a mile or two. Or park at Sanborn County Park, a completely different park that’s adjacent to Castle Rock, and try to use nothing but paper maps and your spotty intuition to get there. All the official brochures with maps along with a personal elevation map I had made.
 <em>
  I was not going to get lost!
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 You fucking idiot. Of course, you got lost.
</p>

<p>
 I rummaged through my bag to grab what would be my second chocolate bar of the day. They claim to be protein bars, but is ten grams of protein really all that? Could probably get more protein by scavenging around the trail for something, I thought. It was too early to be deliriously digging through the forest for food too.
</p>
<p>
 The sun was at its peak around now, so I was taking a break every so often. At least I had my hat on. It felt nice to stop, and bask in the view to the east. Skyline ridge trail is gorgeous. Part of the much larger Bay Area ridge trail, a portion of it goes through Sanborn and Castle Rock. I had made my way up to it over the last hour.
</p>
<p>
 I could see the vast valley, with some buildings sticking out. I tried to use downtown SJ, Apple’s HQ mothership, and Hangar 1 in Moffett Field to triangulate where I must be on the map.

 I thought real hard, overclocking my brain momentarily. I promptly gave up. I was somewhere on this map, that was all I could make out at the moment. I had clearly reached some kind of viewpoint, and after gulping down some water, I asked some fellow hikers for help.
</p>
<p>
 It was a couple - one was convinced that I should go down one particular trail, while the other was convinced of a different trail that supposedly headed down towards highway 35, and eventually Castle Rock. I assumed the role of the jury now. The boyfriend was making some good points about how he had hiked here dozens of times, but the girlfriend said he got lost in the mall all the time. Hmm. Do I want to take advice from someone who gets lost in Valley Fair? I get lost in Valley Fair too, to be fair.
</p>
<p>
 I was unconvinced by either person’s case. I said thank you, and flipped a coin in my head. It rolled a heads. I was going down the longer trail the girlfriend recommended.
</p>
<p>
 The next hour or so, I descended down the ridge to the east. I sat on a stump for a bit. It was a little cooler and a little more shaded now. The way the local weather works in the mountains is that…it varies every half mile or so. The side of the mountain you’re on, the elevation of your particular location, the time of day, even the size of the ocean currents that day.
</p>
<p>
 Passing some larger rocks now, I caught writings and drawings on one of them. Hieroglyphs and petroglyphs alike. Seeking around, there were some chalky rocks nearby, and I tried to draw a happy sunny scene with mountains in the back. It felt right.

<p>
 Eventually, I was by a trail where I could catch the humming of cars on the highway not so far. It must be Highway 35. It felt like being connected to society again. Unbeknownst to me, lots of mountain homes were not all that far from me. In the months following, a friend of mine took me to her dad’s mountain lodge in the mountains, and sure enough it was a few miles away from there. I was just six miles away from Boulder Creek, really.
</p>
<p>
 Confident I was on the right trail, I consulted with my maps. Not only was I right, but I’d be more or less following a contour line for a bit. That meant little to no change in elevation, and that meant one happy hiker. I was going northward now, and soon enough I actually ran into the highway.
</p>
<p>
 Some cars flew by. I wasn’t meant to
 <em>
  get
 </em>
 to the highway. The trail I was on was meant to keep ambling north, towards Castle Rock. I had made a wrong-turn earlier, and so I turned around, not for the last time that day.
</p>
<p>
 I spent the next hour or so bouncing between the trail and the highway. I knew the trail on the other side of the highway would come soon, but not exactly when and where. I kept on the road - looking for
 <em>
  any
 </em>
 trail on the other side to get on to. It was like I was waiting for my exit on a freeway. No, no thoughts about freeways right now.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, I walked up to the highway, expecting nothing. There was the trail, waiting like a red carpet laden in sticks in leaves for me. I was in the limits of Castle Rock State Park now.

<p>
 Unsurprisingly the highway follows a flat corridor of the mountains. The Castle Rock trail on the other side was also flat for a while, and had wide open clearings in between the forest every so often. The clearings were nice. They let me look at where I was on my GPS tracking app. Yeah I was using that now - I had rolled a tails in my head earlier that allowed me to. My hike, my rules. The app didn’t show where too many features were though, but I knew I was headed towards the rock.
</p>
<p>
 Before I got to the main Goat Rock, I walked past other almost-as-impressive boulders. The climbers would begin here as a warm-up, then go all the way to the bottom of Goat Rock to climb it.

 Soon, I had made my way to Goat Rock. There’s lots of great view spots around, but I wanted to be on top of it. It was waiting for me, and my climb to get a view was much smaller than what those mountain climber would do, thankfully.

 I was treated to an expansive and breezy view. The clouds had been rolling in, and as a result the sun wasn’t beating down as hard anymore. A family sat atop the rock with me, taking in the view while some of their youngest and oldest struggled to get atop the Goat Rock wall. They made it up eventually to join me.

 I spent a good bit of time at the tranquil Goat Rock, until I realized I should at least try and beat sundown. My map had a couple different trails and paths I could take to get to my car in Sanborn, and I realized it was a graph theory problem. Which path do I pick? The shortest, the greediest algorithm? Or do I saunter between all these trails, taking my sweet time? Overcome with options, I rolled a dice in my head this time. A four. It didn’t matter though, I just spent the next few hours getting lost again.
</p>
<p>
 Not a person in sight for a while. Just me and the forest.
</p>
<p>
 I had thought La Honda was intriguing as a small town, but it’s honestly just the tip of the iceberg here. Beyond the tech CEOs who hide in their mountain mansions, there’s countless hidden communities, century-old abandoned buildings, secret marijuana farms, exotic supercar meetups, and probably chupacabra. I had run across some strange sheds and water tanks already. At least one of the older water levers let me refill my bottle.
</p>
<p>
 Once, I had stumbled upon a place called Sveadal a bit further south in the mountains near Uvas Canyon and Morgan Hill. Apparently, Sveadal is a Swedish-American only community that’s been visited by the Swedish royal family on multiple occasions. I also think it may or may not be a cult.
</p>
<p>
 Maybe a cult wouldn’t be so bad though. I could use some people to talk to and help me instead of being lost alone. The park ranger hadn’t been of much help. I know I had also spent the last half hour going down the wrong Peterson Trail. I might be on the right one now. It was slowly beginning to get dark, but something was clicking. I was finally getting lucky flipping coins in my head, and picking the right path over and over again.
</p>
<p>
 I could see the Sanborn parking lot again. There was some play happening with dozens of patrons, some holding wine flights, at the small Hillside amphitheater. I knew where my car was, I had made it. I had been running parts by this point. What a day.
</p>
<p>
 Do I go home and cook something healthy and warm for myself? Or do I grab some greasy fast food on my way home? I rolled a die in my head again, and you know what it told me to do.

 The area encompassed by Castle Rock and the Santa Cruz mountains has been continuously inhabited for thousands of years. Referred to collectively as the Ohlone, various different tribes of indigenous people lived, and continue to live here. Here’s a
 <a href="https://santacruzmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Copy-of-Bay-Area-Native-Peoples-and-Languages.pdf">
  link
 </a>
 to a very helpful map created by the Santa Cruz historical museum, which allows you to see the different tribes along with the language groups that unite them. The borders that exist in that map are just to mark where pronounced differences in primary languages were noticed, these didn’t operate in the way modern borders tend to. It’s just really neat to see a map of who the area was primarily defined by before Spanish or American settlers came by.
</p>
<p>
 And of course, when Spanish settlers did arrive in the late 18th century, they didn’t take the land in peace. They ousted the locals and forced the natives to live in Missions and learn Spanish, with the ultimate goal of converting them to Christianity.
</p>
<p>
 Increasing development followed, and American settlers of course only continued the desecration of the area and people. Not many survivors of certain tribes remain. And the valley known as the San Lorenzo Valley (think Felton, Scott’s Valley, Bonny Doon) was heavily logged, especially after the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
</p>
<p>
 Where does that leave us? The San Lorenzo Valley today houses nearly 35,000 people - and all of everyone that I’ve met, kind. The indigenous groups and organizations that do exist though are unfortunately few and small - but still holding a foothold in the local space. There’s the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, the Pajaro Valley Ohlone Indians. These tribes work to now spread their message and their history, and most importantly, continue fighting the changes our imperial and capitalist world has and continues bringing them.
</p>
<p>
 I appreciate the effort put in by the Midpeninsula Open Space District and the Peninsula Open Space Trust, along with the state and counties and tribal organizations.
</p>
<p>
 These groups are going about it the right way. Portions of the land are conserved and dedicated for solely grazing, or solely recreation-based areas, or solely historical significance. The hiking trails are well maintained, camping resources are good, and the whole having-numbered-junctions thing really is a lifesaver. I’ve been able to meet a guy at Midpen who helped advocate for and add the junction numbering system. Those maps become so much easier to use, and anything that keeps you from straying off trail is generally a good thing.
</p>
<p>
 Yet, the current establishment is all in on privatizing our country’s landscapes and selling them off, but these are things we can prevent together. It’s not the government’s land to sell, and it’s not ours either. We can help prevent these things together. Some years ago, the city of San Jose tried to pitch a large development within Alum Rock Park and the only reason it never happened was because people came out and rallied hard against it together. We can cause changes to happen in terms of preventing and supporting certain land uses over others. I think we owe it to the stewards of the lands who have lived here far longer than us.

 There’s a common tendency to think that opposing housing development subsequently means you can’t support any development either. But the way I see it, we should up zone all our urban areas

 before we start encroaching on the mountains and preserves around us. I understand it’s tougher than that, since neighborhoods of low density normally prefer to stay that way. But, the solution is never to just keep developing further and further away from city centers and taking up continually more space. Especially when we tend to build in fire prone areas when we build on mountains. Insurance rates are high, and houses will burn down in California. The Santa Cruz mountains had the terrible CZU lighting complex fire in 2020, and disasters like those can be unavoidable.

 The end goal should be to protect, tend to, and nurture the mountains and people as we live there, right? Not just to sell it off to the highest bidders.

 This was enjoyable to write, and I hope it encourages you to go hike by Castle Rock if you’ve not been. The mountains are a constant looming presence around here, so I’ll probably keep writing about them in the substack. There’s so many stories to draw from solely from growing up near them. There was science camp in fifth grade, random field trips to the ranches in the foothills, experiencing Mystery Spot for the first time, and now camping and hiking in the open spaces. There’s only so much time one can spend in the city and traffic. The trees and mountains call for us in those moments. Take some time to bask in the remoteness of the mountains - I don’t think you’ll ever regret that.

 I posted last weekend - a more casual post about my time in San Diego during college. I didn’t originally intend to email that to everyone - but I hope you didn't mind. It definitely doesn’t concern the south bay, but I was just feeling nostalgic.

 This weekend, I hope to post about the pride parade in SF and my day spent in the city at a historic gay bar. I also want to start a new episodic style of posting, similar to what I do with bars but for interviews with local journalists, athletes, artists, and general “culture-swayers”. I have a couple on my list that I’m going to reach out to, so stay tuned for that. As always I encourage comments, and please let me know if there’s a certain style or topic you would enjoy reading the most.

 Thanks for reading!
