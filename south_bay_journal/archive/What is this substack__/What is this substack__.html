 Good question. You know when you hang out with your friend who’s from (insert trendy Austin/Portland/Seattle type city). Who thinks the bay starts with SF and ends with Oakland/Berkeley? They’ve probably never gone further south of the Mission district. They’ve probably heard that San Jose is a car-focused sprawling hellscape with zero culture. Or maybe you have a friend who lives in LA whose convinced that everyone up here just wears Patagonia jackets and works at a Hooli type company. Or maybe you went on vacation and you had a conversation that went like this:
</p>
<p>
 “Oh I’m from Campbell.”
</p>
<p>
 “Where’s that?”
</p>
<p>
 “Oh my bad, it’s near San Jose.”
</p>
<p>
 “Where’s that?”
</p>
<p>
 (With gritted teeth) “It’s about an hour south of San Francisco.”
</p>
<p>
 “Oh shit I love San Francisco that’s cool!”
</p>
<p>
 Yeah. I love SF too. But, I want this substack to be focused on the south bay and San Jose - a part of the bay that people don’t talk as much about! The most
 <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/san-jose-is-the-most-forgettable-major-american-city/">
  forgettable city in the US?
 </a>
 I mean, are they wrong? Yes, it is a largely SFH city with stroads everywhere and abolutely ridiculous living prices. Yes, the social scene of the towns and SJ can be lacking here. And it’s true, a lot of people DO think about Leetcode and Teslas and VC money too often…
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 But, it’s our city.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 The point of this substack is a kind of love letter to the south bay (while probably also being hate mail sometimes). I love to hate on the south bay sometimes, but I do it because I love so many parts of it. I’m sure that’s a feeling many people who grew up can echo.
</p>
<p>
 The idea here is to document the things happening in the area through writing about beloved spots to eat/drink, sports happenings, events, places to hike, etc. And also to write about the things people growing up here might be able to relate and read about. We’ve all hiked up to Mission Peak, we all did science camp and kissed a banana slug, we all wondered what happens at the Shen Yun show, and we all have spent two hours losing our minds on 101!
</p>
<p>
 Personally, I love going out to new downtown areas, hiking in the Santa Cruz mountains when I can, and keeping tabs on develepments in the area. Plus - I’m a pretty big Earthquakes fan to boot. If any of that (or just any south bay culture or narrative based short form writing) appeals to you, I think you may enjoy what I write. I plan to write when I’m inspired, and that could be after doing something or ruminating with some thoughts I have. There’s no clear time table for me - the only goal is for this to keep me writing. It’s as much for myself as it is the readers!
</p>
<p>
 Disclaimer: Sometimes I may write about something completely unrelated to the bay too!

  Now, what do I consider the south bay?

 This is probably a conversation that has different answers to every person here. For me, the south bay includes San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Campbell, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Saratoga, and Mountain View. And generally the towns and areas surrounding these cities. From the mountains and hills on either side to the bay to the north, and maybe even towns that are close by and common destinations. I spent many a summer days as a kid and as an adult going to Santa Cruz, and while I recognize it’s not a part of the south bay - it will always be linked and a part of the sphere I frequent.

 <strong>
  How can you write a newsletter about the bay without knowing (insert some niche bay reference here)?
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 I'm young, and I haven’t been to many places around the area yet either. I don’t know everything, or even close. That’s a part of this. If any people start reading and interacting with this page, that would be amazing! I would love to learn about new spots or new places I don’t know about, or sub cultures I’ve never been a part of. As much as I want to talk about the bay, I want to learn about the bay and the people who made the area. I’m here for the “Valley of the Heart’s Delight” conversation just as much as I am for “Silicon Valley” conversation.

 <strong>
  Some places/events I’m meaning to go to and write about soon:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Hiking Mt Bielawski
</p>
<p>
 AppleJacks in La Honda
</p>
<p>
 Getting lost in Castle Rock/Sanborn for the millionth time
</p>
<p>
 Mountain View Tree Lighting ceremony
</p>
<p>

<p>
 Thanks for reading. Hope to see you again!
