 There are some places in the world where time stands still, and all the obligations of the world seem so far. You enter these places and feel as if you&rsquo;ve been disrobed of your anxieties. No stressors and no worries, you just are.
</p>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s somewhat a fleeting feeling - but we all recognize it. Maybe you feel it in your yard in late October as the cold breeze begins to make itself at home again. Maybe you feel it when you visit your favorite aunt&rsquo;s house again, where the world is seemingly still stuck at the time when you were just a child. Maybe you feel it sitting in the open trunk of a friend&rsquo;s car, soliliquizing about the same old stories.
</p>
<p>
 For me, dive bars encapsulate that feeling so wonderfully well. A place to sit and avoid judgement, surrounded by chatter of a lively community around you. And unlike a cocktail bar, there&rsquo;s no rush to order and leave. Instead, a stench of beer surrounds you. Your bartender asks you if you want a drink, it&rsquo;s okay if not. The lights flicker, the bumpy pool tables break, and the television shouts.
</p>
<p>
 Molly Magee&rsquo;s is one such place. Located in the middle of Castro Street in humbly small downtown Mountain View, it&rsquo;s an unassuming place from the outside. It&rsquo;s surrounded by larger restaurants and bars on either side of it, but the lack of a grand entrance is part of what makes it what it is. You walk past two brightly lit green shamrocks, through a wooden door, and follow a small passage into Molly Magees.
</p>
<p>
 As I said to a friend once, one of my favorite things about Molly Magees is that they don&rsquo;t have a kitchen. There&rsquo;s no degenerate food-eaters in the bar, just good old drinkers (that&rsquo;s a joke). Castro Street contains lots of other restaurants with bars, but I find that the restaurants are the main focus of the majority of them. In turn, I think this leads to some different clientele and you get a wider range of people in Molly Magees.
</p>
<p>
 I like going with friends, or even alone. People are looking to talk to others, and there&rsquo;s a large selection of beers and liquor at solid prices. Every bartender is always incredibly friendly, especially Desmond. He&rsquo;s the man steering the ship. I ask about one of the specialty Thursday drinks they offer, and if I should get it.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s shit.&rdquo; he shakes his head.
</p>
<p>
 Well, there&rsquo;s some wonderful honesty you won&rsquo;t hear at many other bars. Saved my taste buds, and I get a rum and coke like always. Desmond is generous with his pours.
</p>
<p>
 Between 6 PM to around 9ish on weekdays, the bar is mostly people stopping by for a pint after work, often tech work. After around 9, esepcially on a weekend, the bar swells into a larger group, and it does get a little less homogenous. Sometimes, on weekends or special occasions, a dance floor opens up which leads to a larger group of people too. Everyone loves dancing! I&rsquo;ve met people of many different walks of life, and only had one (singular) bad experience at Molly Magees. Some days I&rsquo;ve met a teacher, some days a natural gas worker, some days a restaurant server. With each one you can share yourself but also take from others and learn so much from.
</p>
<p>
 One of my favorite interactions was with a group of people in town all the way from Sao Paulo. They taught me some rudimentary Portuguese and I tried my best to pronounce the words right and in an inoffensive way. They talked about the hustle and bustle of Sao Paulo, and to them, Mountain View was a quaint town in comparison. To me, Mountain View is a medium sized city - not Hallmark small, but not like a CITY city either. Nothing crazy or big. Hearing about Sao Paulo reminded me of Mumbai though. A city of millions that has something happening in every alleyway and street. You could spend an year in these cities and never explore a fifth of the human experience there to discover.
</p>
<p>
 But when you&rsquo;re sat downstairs by the bar at Molly Magees, who knows what&rsquo;s outside. You feel tucked away in the coziness of the hazy green and blue lights. You might as well be anywhere in the world. You&rsquo;re in a haze.
</p>
<p>
 A half hour passes by. Another hour does too. You&rsquo;ve had a drink or two and every person looks like a conversation waiting to unwrap. As the night gets drunker so does the writing.
</p>
<p>
 I try my hand at the bathroom. As I leave, I lurch past the mirror. I look like I haven&rsquo;t had a sleep in days. You look like you haven&rsquo;t had a sleep in days, I say. He hardly reacts. I go back and take a seat again. The moment&rsquo;s changed, and with it the bartender.
</p>
<p>
 Another drink, and I meet eyes with someone new. They want to talk about football. I try to keep pace and mention Kaepernick. They mention the knee. They weren&rsquo;t a fan. I retreat into my rum.
</p>
<p>
 I meet eyes with someone new. They tell me I&rsquo;m young enough to be their son. They buy me a beer, and ask me if I&rsquo;ve thought of marriage. Of course not. I ask if they have, and have seemingly forgotten that they mentioned their wife dozens of times by now. They tell me places I need to go to with a partner, and I try and take mental notes. They give me some more advice, some of it professional. And then they leave with their friends, off to drive to Tracy. The beer is too bitter, and so I retreat into my phone this time.
</p>
<p>
 The content is endless. I read something and it agitates me. I close my phone and look up to the rest of the bar. You should close your phone more.
</p>
<p>
 A man with a jacket as beaten up as the wood on the bar talks to me. He says he&rsquo;s looking for any fix. I lie, and say I don&rsquo;t have anything. I slink into my chair, and watch as some others sat by the bar engage in animated conversation. I&rsquo;m jealous, and so I find myself a companion. Their name is Pliny and they were brewed in Santa Rosa supposedly.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kinda near Tracy right?&rdquo; I think to myself. Those guys who left earlier. There&rsquo;s something there, and I make a physical note of it this time. You need to write about that.
</p>
<p>
 My friends have left, and the strangers seem to be leaving too. I hope I haven&rsquo;t made a fool of myself tonight. At least I got some things off my chest tonight. Searching for something to do, next you try your hand at a game of pool.
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;ve got no idea what the techniques are. I&rsquo;m too embarassed to ask and I&rsquo;d rather just hit the cue ball, and hope the striped ones ping in. One final shot to go. I take the shot, and then I get ready to take my shot. I close my eyes, and the words of
 <em>
  Invictus
 </em>
 reverberate through my body.
 <em>
  I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 No luck. You&rsquo;ll be back to try your hand at pool again. I&rsquo;m not even sure if I love pool that much, least of all alone. I like the pool game on my phone though. You should close your phone, I remember. The train schedules are on there though. No. No, I think. No, I have a physical pamphlet. I flip through, and thankfully I have time - it&rsquo;s a weekday. The orange line is your friend, you&rsquo;ve written a whole post about it.
</p>
<p>
 I thank Desmond for the drinks. I nod at the ones who were unlucky or lucky enough to engage in conversation with me. Perhaps I was unlucky to talk to a few of them. I leave, as the shamrock clovers and their lights shine on me for the last time that night.
</p>
<p>
 The music blares in my headphones as I look out the window of the train. All my favorite bands are playing. I play the band that the bartender says he loves. Guess I don&rsquo;t love it as much, but they&rsquo;re fine. I play my comfort band, and songs in Hindi and Gujarati shuffle in between. I want to be home now, Alum Rock or maybe elsewhere. I think I heard this song for the first time when I was a child in Mumbai. The train halts and I&rsquo;m close.
</p>
<p>
 At home, I lurch past the mirror in the bathroom. I know you haven&rsquo;t had a good sleep in days, I say. He hardly reacts. You hardly react. Whatever. I retreat into my room and have a lie down. I can&rsquo;t wait to go to Molly Magees again.

 I don&rsquo;t think many places like Molly Magees exist in the south bay. The age of dive bars is seemingly dying, and instead the age of large facilites made to capture your eyes and service you with unsatisfying cocktails is here (think Top Golf, Tipsy Putt, axe throwing corporate-event bars).
</p>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s like the small town church up against a megachurch Jesus show. Blasphemous to compare bars to going to church or a temple you say? It likely is. But bear with me. I&rsquo;m not a religious man, for many a reason, and I can&rsquo;t say I can pinpoint exactly what people turn to religion for. But, I gather, it&rsquo;s for some sense of hope and a place of reflection with the guidance of a community. You share your troubles, your fears, your worries with the one who is highest or most learned, and the answers come in the form of support from other religious attendees. You hope you find those who have had the same experiences and can help you make sense of it. With this framing, I begin to understand the appeal of wanting to attend some group that shares your faith and rewards with community for going every week. A church, a mosque, a temple, a synangogue. A dive bar. The specifics don&rsquo;t matter.
</p>
<p>
 On the other hand, there&rsquo;s commodified religion. It becomes a show. Pay an exorbitant amount of money to watch someone like Joel Osteen lecture you on morality with a lights show at the end! Watch your favorite theological stories with fascist undercurrents, but animated and produced by your favorite streaming service juggernaut! Donate to help pay for a state sponsored temple that cuts funding for education in the area&hellip;.you get where I&rsquo;m going. A place that once promised community turned into a monster, under a system rewarding flashiness and profit by appealing to the lowest common denominator. Beloved community places turn into upscale meeting spots, and the business-vest wearing managers roars with laughter to the clink of $30 martinis.
</p>
<p>
 Your bartender asks you if you want a drink, it&rsquo;s okay if not. The lights flicker, the bumpy pool tables break, and the television shouts.
</p>
<p>
 Side note&hellip; happy New Year&rsquo;s Eve and happy 2025!
