 I’m on the Caltrain right now. Specifically, the new electric ones, which are the only trains they’re running now:

 Look at that. Sleek, clean, quiet, powerful; these are some of the words that come to mind when seeing the new trains. What’s not to love? The WiFi is great, the charging ports work, and every car in the train only gets more packed as we get further up the peninsula. And, in just about an hour’s time, the train had arrived at the central San Mateo station.

 On its own, the electrification of Caltrain already stands as a great improvement, but it’s important (and even better) remembering that it is only the start of what is a bright future of rail in California. The modernization of Caltrain is the first of the rewards we get to reap thanks to California High-Speed Rail (commonly referred to as CAHSR). Between San Francisco and San Jose, the high-speed rail will use the existing Caltrain corridor; and as a result, a third of the cost of Caltrain electrification was funded by the CAHSR Authority. Electrifying allows Caltrain to increase the frequency of trains, enable faster (along with quieter) service, and the possibility of improving our local air quality by cutting out the emissions caused by the original diesel-powered locomotives. Less exhaust, and plus, take a look at this video shared by Caltrain:
</p>
<div class="native-video-embed">
</div>
<p>
 The old train has hardly made it out of the Palo Alto station while the electric train seems to be halfway to San Jose. Okay, that’s an exaggeration - but this acceleration does mean quicker travel time. San Jose to King &amp; 4th Street in San Francisco goes from 100 minutes, to about 77. And this isn’t even high-speed rail, those will go at speeds of up to 220 miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
 Ultimately, the two systems of Caltrain and CAHSR will share the tracks from Diridon Station all the way to the Salesforce Transit Center in San Francisco, both being two relatively new transit hubs with so much development yet to come.

 Today, I had parked and gotten on at Diridon, which serves as a connector for not only Caltrain and CAHSR in the future, but Amtrak, ACE train, VTA light rail, a bus to Santa Cruz, Greyhound buses, Flixbus, and EIGHT different VTA bus lines as of now. The station is located right by the SAP center and not far from downtown SJ, and
 <a href="https://sfyimby.com/2024/12/meeting-tomorrow-for-diridon-station-plaza-towers-san-jose.html">
  there are proposals to build two mixed-use office towers across the street now
 </a>
 . All this development makes sense, as I mentioned, Diridon is set to be one of three high-speed rail stations in the bay, along with San Francisco and Millbrae.
</p>
<p>
 All these changes will serve to only help improve the readership which had dipped in COVID, but has rebounded strongly since electrification. Personally I don’t travel up and down the peninsula particularly often, but this makes me want to change that. Driving up to San Francisco can be a pain, and I could wax on and on about the hours I have lost to it, but I'll save you the melodrama. Taking the train is undoubtedly a more pleasant experience.
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps I’ve sort of romanticized it, but the idea of hopping on a train or subway to travel to new cities and neighborhoods is as intoxicating as any hallucinogen could ever dream to be. Experiencing new regions and towns of your own area is a joy I’ve come to cherish more as of late (partly in thanks to this substack), and trains provide us such an incredible avenue for that. They are invaluable for commutes to work and school, yes. They allow us to connect with loved ones and visit home when we need to, yes. But they allow us to do these things while opening the doors to all the communities in between, and more importantly, the people in between. I absolutely love making conversation with people on the train sometimes, it just feels so much easier and natural compared to being on a packed plane.
</p>
<p>
 With that in mind, I do also just grow unhealthily obsessed with learning about and looking into “new” cities every so often. San Mateo was my latest victim. Somehow, I don’t think I had ever been to this peninsula city, and I was determined to explore it with the help of the new Caltrain…
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 I looked back at my drivel in satisfaction. A good two paragraphs written, and I had arrived in San Mateo. I judged the ride a success and scrambled out of the train, making sure to remember to grab my charger.
</p>
<p>
 It was only the last week of February but the sun felt like it was beating down already. No, it’s just the fool’s spring and I’m no fool. That’s what I told myself as I bumbled down the wrong direction of the station. Whoops. I turned around, slid my warm jacket off, and embraced the title of a fool momentarily.
</p>
<p>
 I had no particular goals today. I walked and walked and walked. As I learned, downtown San Mateo is no joke. I guess there’s a reason I had seen people online refer to it as the best suburban downtown in the bay.
</p>
<p>
 There are several streets completely pedestrianized with no cars. Colorful illustrations are on the street now, and historic architecture adorns every block. It’s Thursday and a little past noon, but people are out.
</p>
<p>
 I walk past Main Street, which seems like more of a back alley to the real main street on B Street in truth. I meander between the blocks, surprised to find more stores, restaurants, and cafes in every corner. I walk into a cafe whose smells entice me, only to ask where the library is. The barista has no clue either.
</p>
<p>
 It’s okay. I walk southwest, and in a little bit, I end up at San Mateo Central Park.
</p>
<p>
 The park is big, and I sneak past the baseball field and concessions stand, and go by a big grass clearing. The train ride had been short, and I wanted to sit for longer. I saw an empty bench, and sat down.
</p>

<p>
 That’s a nice view, I thought. Funky music in my headphones played, and I sat contently, people watching for nearly half an hour. Joggers jogged by, mothers with strollers strolled by, and yoga ladies, well, yogad by.
</p>
<p>
 It was dense around the park. There were numerous large office buildings, some towering over the park giving the sky some character. New apartment towers were surrounding the park, and a diverse ages of people seemed to live in them. I felt like I was in an urban environment.
</p>
<p>
 After nearly half an hour of idly sitting, I seeked to leave the park and attack downtown from a different angle and street. As I meadered out of the park, I stumbled into the Japanese Tea Garden. Excitedly, I walked in, and strolled by the serene lake filled with koi fish. A traditional tea house was in front, with statues of Buddha and pagodas around. I was treated to an even nicer view than before.

<p>
 That’s heaven, and it’s in San Mateo, I guess. I admired the gardens and relaxed at yet another bench for nearly half an hour before I finally departed the park.
</p>
<p>
 I was on what seemed to be another main drag. I was enjoying the feeling of being a tourist in San Mateo, even though I had only traveled from San Jose. Smells from various different restaurants enticed me to get food, and at one point a sickly sweet smell lured me into a shop. I contemplated a peach milk tea which nearly forced my wallet out. A fool and his money has easily parted, I remembered. I’m no fool.
</p>
<p>
 The architecture in San Mateo was wonderful, and some buildings were reminiscent of the classical architectural styles that are commonplace in San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
 Eventually, I was drawn towards a small corner bookstore. Located at the corner of B Street, it was (aptly) named B Street Books. Inside, there were overflowing shelves with books of all kinds. Some were extremely old and original editions, some were new releases, and some were pamphlets and booklets and textbooks of intriguing origins. I found one pamphlet published by Marin County about the geological terrain of the area, and it seemed to be a book meant for internal staff. Very interesting. There were sections dedicated to every topic, and little nooks to sit by and read. I pondered buying a mystery novel about contemplating murder on a train, but I just made note of the name, “Strangers on a Train”. I would be a stranger on a train soon, hopefully without a random proposing a trade of murders though.
</p>
<p>
 The owner seemed lovely and ushered me to a section of local history when I asked later. I found a book about local architecture in the bay, centered primarily around San Francisco. Great find, and I picked it up to do some architectural spotting in the future. Maybe I’d learn about the historic San Mateo buildings.
</p>
<p>
 I left and pondered some more stores before I decided to call it a day. That had been a pleasant way to spend my day.
</p>
<p>
 I hurried back onto the new electric Caltrain, eager to write of it. I stopped at the Mountain View station on the way home, and maybe you could guess why. A stop at Molly Magee’s. Why not? Everything’s on route of Caltrain.
</p>

 Let’s have a sidebar. Santa Clara Valley has actually had electric rail long before the Caltrain electrification project, as I only recently found out. I’ve been reading a book called “The Valley of the Heart’s Delight” by Robin Chapman, a local and very experienced journalist. Sidebar to the sidebar, I would love to write more about this book and the many wonderful anecdotes and stories it has of the south bay, and I may just do that in the future.
</p>
<p>
 As I read in the book, and scouring the internet after, the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_Railway_(California)">
  Peninsular Railway
 </a>
 was an old electric interurban line that functioned in the early 1900s. It originally began as the San Jose and Los Gatos Interurban railroad, and was popular as a result of the prevalence of unpaved roads and expensive automobile prices for the average family. It was expanded soon, by the Pacific Railroad, and included multiple expansive lines in the end that totalled eighty-one miles of track.

 The train cars themselves were wooden and a deep red, much darker then the red we see on Caltrain. From what is now the Ravenswood Open Space Preserve by the Dumbarton Bridge in Palo Alto, it went to Cupertino, Los Altos, Los Gatos, and San Jose - for as little as a dime. Multiple electricity substations in the valley itself sourced it, and connected the various towns and fruit orchards that adorned the landscape back then.

 By the early 1910s, roads across California began to get paved, including El Camino Real. Along with it, automobiles became more accessible to the everyman, and the prices of a car dropped. All this led to interurban line ticket sales dropping which, along with the Great Depression, meant it ceased to operate around 1935.
</p>
<p>
 Even today, we can find some of the old depots and stops around the valley. Tom’s Depot, for example, is a small corner grill in Los Altos that used to serve as the Loyola Corners stop in Los Altos. Many of the buildings for the stops have been repurposed, while others have been completely demolished. Maybe at one point, I can go on a small pilgrimage to the ones that remain.

 Over a century later, Caltrain and BART have taken over here in the bay. High-speed rail is also just around the corner, and already proving to be a worthy investment based solely on
 <a href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2025/01/28/caltrain-ridership-up-again-demonstrating-spark-effect-of-electrification">
  increased ridership since Caltrain has gone electric
 </a>
 . Yet, CAHSR is one of the most critiqued infrastructure projects in this country. President Trump has unsurprisingly been a vocal critic, and took funding in his first term, while he is attempting to review the project probably for similar reasons now. This is despite him having said once that he wishes that America could compete with the trains of China. I guess that’s what you can expect from someone advised by Hyperloop founder and professional idiot Elon Musk though.
</p>
<p>
 Regardless, the idea that CAHSR is a waste of taxpayer money is commonly expressed by people across the political spectrum sometimes, and I want to go over some of the common complaints.
</p>
<p>
 The biggest critique of CAHSR has been the cost and time of the project as a whole. It’s true, it has cost billions of dollars without any track laid yet, and was promised to be done some four years ago. But let’s do some perspective seeking.
</p>
<p>
 Something that I’ve come to realize though is most people are unaware of how much money is already poured into our freeway system.
 <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/4925">
  According to the state legislature,
 </a>
 Caltrans (the California Department of Transportation) spends close to $15 billion annually on widening highways, constructing overpasses, building bridges, and just maintaining all these projects. Now I’m not here to critique the spending on our freeways, in fact I think it’s hugely important to continue working and improving them. They’re a huge part of the average American’s life, and there can always be infrastructure improvements made for safety and traffic mitigation. But, and this is a big but, we can’t let freeways be the only project we invest federal funding into. Just a fifth of our total transportation budget goes into public transit, which is far too little. Even half would be slightly egregious, and we’re not close to that. All this spending on car infrastructure is unsustainable, since we know widening roads only encourages more driving and will never lessen traffic, while still continuing the emission of carbon dioxide at unacceptable levels for our environment.
</p>
<p>
 Second of all, a big critique has been CAHSR going over budget. But this has been misreported as $33 billion repeatedly, and at this point it’s just the boy crying wolf. In 2008, when HSR was first proposed and subsequently accepted in California, the proposal required the funding of $33 billion, it’s true. By the time voters were deciding the bill’s fate, they had already changed the figure to be $41 billion.
 <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">
  According to the US Bureau of Labor
 </a>
 , accounting for inflation, that $33 billion is more like $49 billion in 2025. The cost of HSR is immense, but it’s only because we are one of the few countries to build it yet oppose it on different levels of governance rather than make it a national goal to achieve. I mean, do you think any level of the Chinese or Japanese government opposed high-speed rail in their respective countries? No, that’s asinine.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, the idea that there is no track laid  yet. First of all, this is demonstrably false because the
 <a href="https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/ceremony-marks-start-of-track-laying-for-california-high-speed-route/">
  first track laying literally happened some months ago at Bakersfield
 </a>
 with Governor Newsom present. For some reason there wasn’t much coverage about this on most newspapers I read online. Also, track laying is one of the final steps of constructing the HSR system anyways. There are numerous steps before it that are much more time consuming and difficult. The CAHSR in the Central Valley is being built on its own new corridor and route, and thus acquisition of all the land and the right of way is its own headache. Farmland is generally owned by large corporations who are unwilling to sell their land or will make it as difficult as possible. When it’s not farmland, it’s dealing with Central Valley cities, who may oppose HSR through the city and will vote on the matter. Finally, there’s all the environmental reviews and processes that are most stringent in California.
</p>
<p>
 The terrain is flat, but filled with metaphorical mountains that hinder construction before it even begins.
</p>
<p>
 Next, there’s all the infrastructure itself. All the freeway crossings, grade-separations projects, and bridges being built all have their own stories. One such example is the McKinley Avenue Grade Separation project, which only broke ground in December. Located in Fresno, it exists to increase safety for cars, bikers, and pedestrians in the area, separating a crossing for a four lane road to be elevated with a roundabout below. Will this project directly serve the CAHSR? No. But it is a reminder that many valuable infrastructure projects are only happening due to CAHSR as well.
</p>
<p>
 If you have yet to see it, here is a map of the eventual CAHSR with all the construction projects, with thirty-five ongoing:

 There’s something hilariously incredible about Merced and Madera being among the first American cities to welcome high speed rail. But despite them not being large cosmopolitan urban centers, I have no doubt in my mind that HSR in these cities, and the Central Valley as a whole, will be incredibly popular and a huge success. I can’t speak on Madera, but I spent a little time living in Merced when I went to college there. It’s a decent sized central valley town with farms for miles around. The downtown is small, and the new university is a big part of the local economy (although located very much in the outskirts). People need to travel around the state from Merced, and I have no doubt this will change transit there. I used to travel from Merced to San Jose by train and bus, and it was not quick or efficient. This project will make travels like that across the state so much easier, and the best part is you can do stuff on the train!

 Yeah, the given completion date of 2031 for Merced to Bakersfield is many years away. And in the bay, it will take many additional years after that to be connected to the system (which is solely Phase 1 of CAHSR). But, is the promise of comprehensive rail transit for future and following generations not enough? In just a few decades, kids will grow up from the Bay Area to the Central Valley to LA knowing that half the state is reachable by high speed train. That’s a win if I’ve ever seen one.

 Regardless, I hope you picked up something about CAHSR while reading this, or simply got inspired to go on an adventure on the closest train to you. Thank you for reading! Enjoy some photos I took in San Mateo below, if you’re interested.
