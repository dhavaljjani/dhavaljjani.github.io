 On a windy evening at Torero Stadium, I had the pleasure of watching a wonderful San Diego Loyal (Rest in Peace!) match. It was also the final game before retirement for fan favorite, and starting Loyal central defender, Sal Zizzo. Since playing for them, he had become a broadcaster and fully entrenched himself with the supporters group. I was able to snag a picture with him and share some quick words that day, and couldn&rsquo;t help but notice tears on his and some supporters around me. When players who have worn the colors, shared the chants, kept us company on weekends, and fought our battles on the field for many years come around, as fans, we form an amazing connection with them. Their stories become intrinsically linked to the story of our club and the city as a whole through their personality, journey to the team, or their acts off the field. There&rsquo;s a reason why Chris Wondolowski and Shea Salinas became such big legends for us in San Jose, for more than even just their stellar play on the field. I feel so strongly about this idea, that as a fan, I would personally prefer a team of guys I love and wholeheartedly want to see do well having a tough season - to a group of soulless players looking to collect a paycheck but winning the championship. A team that wins trophies is in the record books, but a team that embodies the community is in our hearts.
</p>
<p>
 With that, players leaving for transfers, ending their careers for retirement, foraying into coaching or whatnot are inevitable in sport and must be celebrated too. Soon the next MLS season will be underway, and the San Jose Earthquakes roster (to my excitement and slight surprise) features multiple new faces and potential transfers. With it, players have also left and we&rsquo;ve definitely seen the core team change heavily in the past five or so years. So far, Jackson Yueill, Jebo, and  has departed, along with names like Alberto Quintero, Guram Kashia, Jahmir Hyka, and so on who already seem like players with their own folklore. Now, most MLS media doesn&rsquo;t do a great job of keeping fans up to date with where players end up - especially if your new favorite player has moved out of the country or league entirely. With that, let&rsquo;s go over some players who become fan favorites and have also left the South Bay since, and where they find themselves:
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Cade Cowell
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m sure anyone familiar with the SJ Earthquakes knows of Cade and his transfer to Chivas Guadalajara for $4 million dollars. After months of discussion with Bologna from Serie A, the young USMNT forward instead moved south of the border and so far, has impressed on the field. His highlight performance would be his brace and assist against Forge FC (of the Canadian Premier League) in a big CONCACAF Champions Cup affair. The first was an emphatic left footed finish into the corner, and the second was a tidy finish after running in behind. His assist was also with his left foot, a curling ball into the path of Ricardo Marin to head it in. That match seems to have certainly changed the tide of Chivas&rsquo; fans opinions, from tentatively intrigued to excited at Cade&rsquo;s capabilities. Even in his short debut in Liga MX, he looked electric, nearly curling one in as well. For someone who seemed to be stagnating in his last season at the Earthquakes, a new environment seems to have been perfect.
</p>
<p>
 As he had said to
 <em>
  The Athletic
 </em>
 , his primary aim at Chivas is to &ldquo;was be uncomfortable&rdquo; and play at a higher level with bigger and different stakes. He continued, saying, &ldquo;When you go to the national team and play against players like Pulisic and McKennie, I was uncomfortable every day&rdquo;. While I felt that he was stagnating a bit in his last season with us, there&rsquo;s no doubt a fresh new place and team fired him up initially at Chivas, and Cade certainly has the talent to make it work. Technical skills aside, the hunger to improve himself and play at the highest level he can will be necessary if he intends to play and start for the USMNT first XI eventually. He has wholly proved me wrong since he signed for us as a 15 year old, when I thought it was solely a PR move by us, but Cade is really that good. He just has to prove it to the rest of the world this year.
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  La Chofis
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 The Mexican midfielder only played for us on loan for about two years, and yet left a sizable impression on fans. His tight dribbling and small frame made him difficult for oppositions to deal with, and he scored a whole array of golazos for us, including that gorgeous Olimpico to complete a hattrick against Real Salt Lake. It seemed that you could never count out a shot from his left foot, and he scored some gorgeous curlers from outside the box. He shared a close bond with Matias Almeyda as well, and was trusted with lots of starting game time, although his form began to fall off towards the end of his stay.
</p>
<p>
 After leaving the Quakes, he returned to Liga MX and permanently transferred to Pachuca. There, he found championship success, winning the 2022 Apertura. He has shifted to a role more focused on coming off the bench for the last thirty minutes to provide fresh legs in 2023, but still had a good season, and scored

 </a>
 last season as well. It&rsquo;s just kind of amazing to see a 5&rdquo;6&rsquo; player scoring a header at the top level.
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Danny Hoesen
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 Coming to San Jose in 2018, the Dutch striker provided us many moments and goals to remember. His partnership with Wondo up top was great tactically, having a quick agile finisher paired with a fox-in-the-box type poacher allowed us to play a classic 4-4-2 to good effect. He joined fellow ex-Quake (and as of writing this: Quake again!) Nick Lima in Austin in 2021, where he initially struggled to get playing time. In the 2022 season though, he transitioned to an impact sub role, and scored three late goals for Austin. The first was an 80th minute equalizer in a game they eventually won 3-2 against DC, the second was an 85th minute equalizer against FC Dallas (assisted by Nick Lima), and the third was
 <a href="https://youtu.be/KxSrxpL6t_8?t=340">
  this late equalizer against Sporting Kansas City
 </a>
 at home game we did eventually lose 4-3. Despite his late game heroics though, he was released by Austin after 2022. He played a few matches for Eredivisie club FC Emmen before retiring due to injuries unfortunately. Never how a player wants to go out, but thanks for a solid few years Danny!
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Florian Jungwirth
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 Florian Jungwirth, or Flo as he was called by fans, was an ever-dependable and passionate player as any. He was versatile as well, being able to play both as a center back or a defensive midfielder. The German was one of my favorite players while he played for us, and part of it was just because of his immediate buy-in to the club and MLS. He was so invested that after games, he would constantly post about how they would bounce back or do better if it was a loss, and interact with fans online/in person a lot in general. One of my favorite Jungwirth memories was the match against the Galaxy at Stanford, where Zlatan and Wondo scored braces in a draw. He was fired up the whole game and I distinctly remember him shoving Zlatan off the ball at some point.
</p>
<p>
 After losing his place in the Quakes team, he moved to another western conference team in the Vancouver Whitecaps, and served them as a squad player well. He had his taste of silverware there as well, winning the 2022 Canadian Championship. He must have enjoyed his stay in Canada quite a bit too, as he announced his retirement and shift towards assistant coaching initially. In 2023, the ex-Darmstadt man announced he would be the head coach for the Vancouver Whitecaps FC U17 team for the coming season.
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Matias Perez Garcia
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 Nothing will summarize MPG as a player more than
 <a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/late-goal-and-later-red-mat-p-rez-garc-steals-show-still-alive-san-jose-earthqua">
  his 90&rsquo; goal and subsequent shirt-off celebration
 </a>
 that earned him a red card against Real Salt Lake. The Argentine playmaker was a hugely talented player with many moments of brilliance (honestly in retrospect he&rsquo;s like a less consistent and slightly slower Hernan Lopez), separated by large swaths of average form, but overall one whose time I look back at in fondness. I was surprised to find out though, that he is still playing, currently in the Peruvian first division for Deportivo Municipal at the age of 40. He did score

 from outside the box, along with

  this free kick
 </a>
 (featuring some slightly shocking goalkeeping). It&rsquo;s still nice to see him finding success there.
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Cordell Cato
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 The speedy Trini winger played for the Quakes for about four years, where he was a consistent squad player and occasional starter. He moved to the USL first to play for the Charlotte Independence, and then to play for OKC Energy, and featured as a starter for both. He also went on to represent Trinidad and Tobago at the 2019 Gold Cup, where they failed to make it out of the group. But, I&rsquo;ll never forget his bronze FIFA card way back which had an ungodly amount of pace.
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Innocent Emeghara
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 One of our more ambitious and intriguing earlier DP signings, Innocent ultimately failed to perform at the level we expected. The Swiss striker only made a total of thirteen appearances, some off the bench as well. He did however
 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqBt5FbaNNw">
  score a peach away in a win against Seattle
 </a>
 , for which he will always be remembered for me.
</p>
<p>
 Innocent continued his playing career for some five years after he left MLS, going from the second division in Cypriot, to the top flight in Azerbaijan, to Turkey&rsquo;s S&uuml;per Lig, until he retired in his home country playing for FC Winterthur. I&rsquo;m kind of jealous, seems like he got to do a small world tour before retirement.
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Marvin Ch&aacute;vez
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 I became a fan of the team around the 2012 and 2013 season, so Marvin Ch&aacute;vez feels like a throwback to when I got into the sport entirely. I didn&rsquo;t recognize him by name at the time, and only got properly deep into the sport a couple years later, but he was a favorite of mine for solely
 <a href="https://youtu.be/sURV1VuRT5U?si=iwiM7ILvrYGO3-zk">
  this moment
 </a>
 . Diabolical.
</p>
<p>
 The Honduran played internationally at the 2014 World Cup after leaving the Quakes, representing them in Brazil. He pinballed between American teams for the rest of his career, having the longest stint in the NASL for San Antonio.
</p>
<h3>
 <strong>
  Nick Lima
 </strong>
</h3>
<p>
 Now, this is a fun one. Fans of MLS will know that Lima went over to Austin FC in their inaugural season of MLS in 2021. He was the starting right-wingback and played at the high intensity that Austin became known for in their initial seasons. In 2019, his form caught the eye of Gregg Berhalter, and he played numerous friendlies for the USMNT as well. Despite the solid form defensively and going forward, Lima was traded by Austin before this season to the New England Revolution.
</p>
<p>
 This is where it gets exciting though, because we signed him back this offseason! Nick Lima is coming back to San Jose after 220 appearances for Austin and New England. And honestly, I&rsquo;m excited. He&rsquo;s still only 30 and Lima&rsquo;s so good offensively that I love watching him work his magic on the right wing sometimes (I also used to play as a right-back so maybe I&rsquo;m biased). He puts in a great ball, and he runs hard to defend every time, to me, he slots into our starting eleven easy.

 Along with these names listed, there are countless others who have represented San Jose in black and blue, from Buckshaw Stadium to PayPal Park. As we look forward to an exciting season coming up, I hope we also find some new faces to become heroes through the year. Some new Goonies. Players who would hurt to lose as much as everyone listed and numerous others have. That&rsquo;s the mark of a great player: one who will be sorely missed.

 I hope this post was enjoyable, I intend to write about the SJ Earthquakes semi-often throughout the season, and this was just me getting a feel for writing about them. I will post again in a couple week as a sort of preview for the season which starts on February 22. That&rsquo;ll be going over the transfer moves San Jose made in the past few months, exciting things to do at games, specific league and team wide stroylines, etc. Even with the soccer posts though, I don&rsquo;t want to slow down writing about the other stuff too, including new bars I visit, cultural observations of the south bay, and various asinine activities I get up to here. Anyways, thanks for reading!
