 For over fifty years, on every first Saturday of a new month, the parking lot at De Anza College in Cupertino transforms. From a barren parking wasteland to perhaps the most crowded spot in the whole city, the De Anza flea market takes over, and people from around the south bay gather. Schoolteachers and students and fathers and grandparents and retired theater artists and tech workers and zookeepers and firemen and probably some tweakers too. All to say, it feels like everyone is at the De Anza flea market. One of the guys who was in a class with me at De Anza had presented at the United Nations in Paris once. What?!? You can find people from everywhere in the bay sometimes, and I love that so much.
</p>
<p>
 Now, going to the flea market just inherently feels great because you get to spend time outdoors while talking to people early in the day. My sleep schedule often doesn’t permit me to be out in social situations early other than for work or a hike I’ve planned out. I only have myself to blame. But regardless, it’s just nice for the soul to be out on a weekend morning. We tend to be more present in the mornings, and I think that it’s inherently better for your wellbeing and mood, as it allows you to experience yourself fully at any moment compared to how you may experience sleep deprived nights.
</p>
<p>
 But even on top of that, there’s the allure of possibly finding an incredible artifact at the flea market. Maybe I have Indiana Jones running too deep in my brain, but I imagine rummaging through a pile of stuff, and discovering an ancient tool or mystic item deep inside someone’s “We’re Cleaning Our House and Here’s Some Shit We Found” stall. Those are some of my favorite flea market sellers anyways.

<p>
 I mean, it could be any niche collector’s item. Maybe a replica trophy for a 1992 Florida racing invitational worth millions to the right person. Or maybe just a musty book about race horses that smells an awful lot like them too. A whole spectrum of
 <em>
  stuff
 </em>
 . You could find anything!
</p>
<p>
 On this day, I don’t know what I was looking for. I just wanted to go back to the flea market in an attempt to reconnect with my past, and hang out with a friend of mine while doing so - who had never been! I was excited about what I’d find between me and him.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 Going back to Cupertino always vaguely feels like a trip to the past for me because I lived there for a very large (and important) part of my life. Doubly the area around De Anza, since there’s so much on that part of Stevens Creek Boulevard. If you grew up in Cupertino, you’d know what I mean. The Cupertino Sports Center is across the community college campus which is where I took tennis classes for years and it was very meaningful for younger me. The YMCA around the corner was where I had done swimming for years, where I went back and forth between loving and hating at the time.
</p>
<p>
 East of De Anza’s college campus features a bunch of stores and places to eat, including Whole Foods, Ike’s Sandwiches, Panda Express, and the church. West of the sports center is the Cupertino Memorial Park, featuring its lovely fields, tennis courts, small amphitheater, and community center. Remember when Memorial Park actually had water and didn’t look like a skating rink? Better days, truly.
</p>
<p>
 On this particular Saturday, I parked by the YMCA some streets away. That’s pro tip #1; don’t park at De Anza since you’ll have to pay - park some streets away and stroll over instead, to take it all in. I was slightly later than I wanted to be, since it was nearing 9. The flea market runs from 8 AM to 1 PM generally. By noon though, most of the vendors are packing up and heading out.

 The lanes were already adorned with all the eager vendors and people. I had been pretty tired in the morning but the flea market was already lifting my spirits - no coffee required. I meandered between rows, and noticed lots of people selling homemade objects today. Lots of local craftsmanship was present, which meant I was walking as slow as ever pondering them all.
</p>
<p>
 I found my way to one family, selling all sorts of crockery and pottery. That’s a mouthful. Much of it seemed handcrafted, and I found out that they had been selling at the flea market for well over fifteen years. They had seemingly built up a famous reputation too - I had heard other buyers mention how this was their favorite stall every month. And I wouldn’t blame them, there were so many different styles of gorgeous cups and pots present, and a cup made of china had tempted me very much.
</p>
<p>
 I kept walking and kept my cash for now. Most of the people and businesses selling take cash only. That’s pro tip #2 (although it should be relatively obvious). Don’t expect your credit and debit cards to carry you through any flea market!
</p>

<p>
 I started coming to the De Anza flea market when I was a kid, with my family. We’d come early in the morning to get some air and perhaps also to barter with some passion.
</p>
<p>
 My mom loved to meander between the lanes, looking to get a deal on some gardening equipment or a fun trinket/painting to decorate our home with.
</p>
<p>
 My dad enjoyed the ambience and the fresh air, but I think he’s always been impartial to farmer’s markets instead.
</p>
<p>
 My sister was a mixed bag, she would either be looking for something very ornate and antique, or she simply wanted some food and a book maybe.
</p>
<p>
 I was a kid - and mostly, I was just glad to be going out with my family and not be at the mall. Going to the mall with my family as a kid was like a death sentence. Trying on pants and shirts and pants and shirts and a sweater and pants and shirts - all to buy one pair of pants maybe. Less fun than trying to find a cool ass item at the flea market, undoubtedly.
</p>
<p>
 Once when I was at the flea market as a kid, my parents found a stall filled with books of all kinds. There were books for both kids and adults. From picture books to cooking books to mystery novels, all looking for a new home.
</p>
<p>
 One book in particular caught kid me’s eyes. It was the Geographica’s “World Reference”. Part atlas, part world reference of just about
 <em>
  everything
 </em>
 about the world. A recounting of the universe physically from the Big Bang, to the evolution of life and our Earth’s accompanying geological history. It followed with the rise of Homo Sapiens Sapiens and our early societies. The bulk of the book is spent in an alphabetical reference of
 <em>
  every
 </em>
 country of the world, with all its statistics mentioned (population, GDP, form of government, capital,  demographics, etc). It was followed by a written history of the country and a modern look into the country as well (modern as in 2000 - when it was published). It contained pictures and prominent stories and cultural values of the vast cultural human experience of every country it aimed to describe. It was the perfect book for me. I spent countless hours as a kid reading it all, and referencing what I read with the extensive atlas in the back. Even today, some countries are forever associated with the words I read in this book about them (ex: China being described as a decidedly enigmatic nation in the book).
</p>
<p>
 This book changed my life, no lie. I quite literally work with maps now (shoutout if you work in or know of GIS) and my obsession with cartography likely stems from this book, preceding Google Maps/StreetView. Geography is also one of my favorite interests, again due to this book. As a kid, I narrowly came second place in the elementary school geography bee, second only to my also geography and cubing obsessed friend. But how our physical Earth forms and how that impacts society and life today is still so important to me, it’s what I aim to get at here in this substack eventually. I still absolutely love this world reference book.
</p>
<p>
 It’s endlessly fascinating to me, and I can’t say I would have discovered it without this book I found in this random stall with my parents, and specifically my mom. I’m grateful to her for the world of cartography she helped me discover in the De Anza parking lot.
</p>

 Today, as I walked around I saw something that my mom would appreciate instead.

 Look at them! Adorable pots shaped like different adorable animals. The rabbit and bird instantly caught my eye, and I knew my mom would love one. I talked to the guys who sold them, who were happy to sell a bird one to me for $10. This is where pro tip #3 comes in. Bartering is your friend. I had nine dollars of change left in cash (I bought a single Pokémon Meowscarada card earlier for a buck), so I asked and he was glad to sell it to me for nine. Reader, you may now clap for me and my incredible haggling skills.
</p>
<p>
 For what it’s worth, I don’t think haggling is always necessary, especially for small amounts. It just made me crack up to get it for nine instead of ten, since I knew my mom would be proud in some odd way.
</p>
<p>
 Eventually, closer to 11, my friend joined me and we began again. Let me recount to you some of the rest of my favorite sights from this particular Saturday:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   One man, along with a whole host of random items, was selling what seemed to be a real street sign from Placer County. Pretty neat to be honest.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   A family selling all kinds of stuff, along with their son who was running his own little Pokémon booth - he was selling packs with discounts if you ripped them right there!
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   There was a somewhat nervous looking woman selling her homemade jewelry with her partner’s hand in her hand in support. Very sweet, and the jewelry was some really intricately made stuff.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   There was a man that sold so many gun holsters that Carlton Lassiter would be proud (and maybe concerned).
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   There was one man all by himself, promoting some corporate grocery delivery system or app or something. He had a matching shirt on and everything, and it made me somewhat happy to see that everyone else seemingly saw through this blatant advertising front. Although he did look a little lonely in his company shirt.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   The coolest Mario themed custom racing jacket I have ever seen. My friend and I debated one for each of us since we’re both Mario Kart Wii nuts, but the price tag convinced us otherwise (it was still fairly priced for the incredible piece of art it is). Here’s a photo of it, along with a couple other things that tempted me very much:

 All in all, it was a great time between my friend and I, and we swore to make this a monthly thing again. These days, the majority of my escapades outside the house involve my friends rather than my family. That’s just the way the cookie crumbles, and how things happened, I guess.
</p>
<p>
 But today, I had acquired a pot shaped like a little red bird, and my mom loved it so much when I gave it to her back at home. We placed some soil and a plant in it together, and it was a good feeling of reconnecting with her about the flea market even if she hadn’t been there with me physically this time. Maybe next time, it was time to go with the family again, and to feel all those feelings again.
</p>

 In a world where we can buy pretty much everything with the ease of a click online; it tends to be so much more meaningful to find those same things in person. Meeting people who make their own art and products and getting to have a chat with them is a privilege of its own, and I highly recommend it. Nowadays, our third places tend to be overtly consumption-based unfortunately, and while a flea market is built around buying and selling - it just feels
 <em>
  so damn different
 </em>
 (in a good way) to traditional malls or whatnot.
</p>
<p>
 Find an flea market or swap meet near you, and if you’re in the south bay - check this one out! I think it’s very worth it, especially with friends or family. I’ve been to open air markets in a few very different places, and the local spins that every place adds is what makes them special. I’ve wandered in the open air markets of the port city of Diu in India, where I saw all kinds of incredibly unique and different items; but at its core, just like the De Anza flea market, it’s people around you selling the things they inherited, the things they’ve found throughout their lives, and the things they’ve created. That’s the heart of it.
</p>
<p>
 And well, if you prefer farmer’s markets, we have some of those around us too - like the Berryessa or Campbell ones.
</p>
<p>
 This post was very casual, and I wanted it to be a small profile of a place I love in a city I love - despite some of its pitfalls. Let me know if you enjoyed it, leave a comment about your experiences here too! I started putting flyers up physically this week on Castro Street in Mountain View, so if you’ve found your way here from those, welcome!

 Hopefully, there’ll be another post up next week, so see you there! March wasn’t the best month in terms of the number of posts I was able to put up, but I have some exciting stuff coming in April. Over the past few weeks, I’ve hiked by the Santa Cruz mountains, traveled to one of the Bay Area’s smallest and most unique towns, and been preparing for an exciting activity I want to be involved with in downtown SJ. That’ll be fun to write about, along with all the other exciting things I have planned - though I’ll keep those under wraps for now.
</p>
<p>
 Stay tuned, and as always, thank you for reading.
