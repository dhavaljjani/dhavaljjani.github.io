 You like to think that when it’s all done and dusted, you’d put up a fight. A fight for your life. It means everything to you, so surely you would. Yet, every time I believe my world to be ended, I find that my mind accepts it easily and instantly.

 It’s a common cliché, but things I see in the early morning in my dreams feel so incredibly real. They lack the dreamlike quality and instead feel like visions of reality. One morning, I had a distinct feeling I was back in our old home. Our family hadn’t lived there for five years at that point, but I was convinced I was in my bed in the bedroom by the window, and I could see the old beaten up golden blanket I used. I could even perhaps make out the sunlight that always entered the room in the mornings. My mom would wake me up for school soon. I was there.

 Sometimes they’re less pleasant. And one of them keeps reoccurring. I had gotten home late. The roads were empty so it had been a deserted drive. I changed and threw my belongings on my table and passed out to sleep. In the morning, I woke up. I looked up and saw the front grill of my car. It was lying on its side, in tatters. Smoke was blowing away. An interstate overpass was above. It hit me. I think I crashed and died last night. My family must have no clue, I thought. They would find out soon, and I know they couldn’t bear it. I couldn’t hear any sirens or ambulances. I was dead, I was so sure.

 When I say it felt like reality - it might as well have been. It sticks in my memory like it was my own. And I just lied in bed and accepted it. I thought, that’s that.

 The crash is a common one. Sometimes it feels like I feel the pain on my body too. I suspect it’s because I did get into a crash early last year. Nothing awful that caused any physical pain, but my car’s front fender and headlight was totalled. And my mind was scarred. And since then, the morning dreams have a new favorite reality to see. And this is pretty common, with every new thing that I encounter in life. Every bad thing that happens to me, or anything that can make me feel awful just resides in my memory - waiting for the day it can haunt me in the morning.

 We need more pleasant memories of our old house. More pleasant memories of a home and family I love. Of a day I love. I can’t deal with the bad memories, clearly. They convince me my world is over. And all I can do is accept that. I can’t control the car in my dreams. I can’t control my dreams. I can’t control my life and my house and my family. And that’s an awful way to start my day.
