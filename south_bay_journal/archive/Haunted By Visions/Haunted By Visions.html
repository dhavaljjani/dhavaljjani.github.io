 You like to think that when it&rsquo;s all done and dusted, you&rsquo;d put up a fight. A fight for your life. It means everything to you, so surely you would. Yet, every time I believe my world to be ended, I find that my mind accepts it easily and instantly.
</p>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s a common clich&eacute;, but things I see in the early morning in my dreams feel so incredibly real. They lack the dreamlike quality and instead feel like visions of reality. One morning, I had a distinct feeling I was back in our old home. Our family hadn&rsquo;t lived there for five years at that point, but I was convinced I was in my bed in the bedroom by the window, and I could see the old beaten up golden blanket I used. I could even perhaps make out the sunlight that always entered the room in the mornings. My mom would wake me up for school soon. I was there.
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes they&rsquo;re less pleasant. And one of them keeps reoccurring. I had gotten home late. The roads were empty so it had been a deserted drive. I changed and threw my belongings on my table and passed out to sleep. In the morning, I woke up. I looked up and saw the front grill of my car. It was lying on its side, in tatters. Smoke was blowing away. An interstate overpass was above. It hit me. I think I crashed and died last night. My family must have no clue, I thought. They would find out soon, and I know they couldn&rsquo;t bear it. I couldn&rsquo;t hear any sirens or ambulances. I was dead, I was so sure.
</p>
<p>
 When I say it felt like reality - it might as well have been. It sticks in my memory like it was my own. And I just lied in bed and accepted it. I thought, that&rsquo;s that.
</p>
<p>
 The crash is a common one. Sometimes it feels like I feel the pain on my body too. I suspect it&rsquo;s because I did get into a crash early last year. Nothing awful that caused any physical pain, but my car&rsquo;s front fender and headlight was totalled. And my mind was scarred. And since then, the morning dreams have a new favorite reality to see. And this is pretty common, with every new thing that I encounter in life. Every bad thing that happens to me, or anything that can make me feel awful just resides in my memory - waiting for the day it can haunt me in the morning.
</p>
<p>
 We need more pleasant memories of our old house. More pleasant memories of a home and family I love. Of a day I love. I can&rsquo;t deal with the bad memories, clearly. They convince me my world is over. And all I can do is accept that. I can&rsquo;t control the car in my dreams. I can&rsquo;t control my dreams. I can&rsquo;t control my life and my house and my family. And that&rsquo;s an awful way to start my day.
