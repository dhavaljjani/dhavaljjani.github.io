 I think that anyone with the willingness to give it a go could get into sport, whether it&rsquo;s playing or watching. Forget the gambling parlays and incessant advertising and the rampant false masculinity for a second.
</p>
<p>
 It is cinema in every way. There&rsquo;s entire storylines filled with heroes, villains, and climaxes. And the best part is that it&rsquo;s all real. It is genuine athletic prowess woven into the finest show of theater. The players experience everything in its rawest form, and we marvel at their composure and skill. You play and you unite and fight with your teammates despite the fact that your lungs ran out of gas ten minutes ago. It&rsquo;s endurance, camaraderie, and anguish. It&rsquo;s making the most difficult decisions in snap moments. Sport, in its most distilled and pure form, can serve as an allegory for life itself.
</p>
<p>
 Yeah I&rsquo;m kind of waxing on about it, but it&rsquo;s because these feelings are what underlay all sport and competition to me. That&rsquo;s the way I&rsquo;ve always felt about it - even the tetherball duels in elementary school. It&rsquo;s easy to be romantic about sport for me.

 A small green book in my room carries a dramatized story about English soccer (football if you&rsquo;d like). Titled &ldquo;The Damned United&rdquo;, it focuses on the polarizing Brian Clough. Brian Clough was an English soccer player, but he&rsquo;s more widely known for his managerial career. He was one of four managers to have won the top division of English football with two different clubs, having won it with Nottingham Forest and Derby County. He won the league cup four times and the European championship twice. In the summer 1978, he was the English manager of the year.
</p>
<p>
 Yet, the book isn&rsquo;t about his successes. It stages his wildest successes next to the forty days after he had signed as the coach of the hugely successful and expectant Leeds United in 1974. What was meant to be the union between a winning team and a winning coach ended up becoming the worst period of Clough&rsquo;s career. It was marred by failing professional and personal relationships, his outspoken mouth and stubborn arrogance, and consuming alcoholism. He was fired in forty days. The book is about those forty days. And it captures something more fascinating than any of his trophies.
</p>
<p>
 The downfall is as romantic as the rise. Because the downfall is the point.
</p>
<p>
 Dawn only comes after dusk. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why I, and so many of us, gravitate towards the ones struggling and fighting in the midst of disarray. The underdogs. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m rooting for smaller countries at the Olympics. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m rooting for the artist that&rsquo;s still unsigned and underground. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m rooting for Bhuvan over Captain Russell.
</p>
<p>
 A very meander-some way to say: perhaps that&rsquo;s why the Earthquakes are so special to me. I&rsquo;ve never seen us have a winning season since I tuned in over a decade ago. In the history of the MLS (a pretty young league), San Jose have won the wooden spoon
 <strong>
  five times
 </strong>
 . The wooden spoon is not something you want to win. It&rsquo;s the unofficial trophy given to the worst team in the league across both conferences. Two of our five &ldquo;wins&rdquo; were in 2018 and 2024. And when we&rsquo;re not &ldquo;winning&rdquo; the wooden spoon, we&rsquo;re lying close to the bottom anyways. Even in the seasons that we manage to worm into playoffs via a miracle, we only proceed to crash out in the first wild card round.
</p>
<p>
 Yet, I keep watching. The failed years are just the forty days. They are necessary. Every time the team fails, we get closer to the summer of 1978. Especially this year, I thought, considering all the changes we had made in the off-season. We wouldn&rsquo;t see the same script play out this season. Buckle up, I&rsquo;m writing about soccer again.
</p>
<div>

<p>
 The season started off in high hopes. As I wrote in an
 <a href="https://southbayjournal.substack.com/p/pre-season-tremors-a-preview-of-the">
  earlier post
 </a>
 on this substack, the signings of Chicho Arango, Josef Martinez, and a couple of others were
 <strong>
  huge
 </strong>
 for us in the offseason transfer window. And of course, the &ldquo;godfather&rdquo; of American soccer, Bruce Arena, was our new head coach. With him, he had brought along some well-performing players from his last team, the New England Revolution. All these factors led to an air of optimism. Ominous clouds gathered in San Jose in early March; it was earthquake weather.
</p>
<p>
 We started off the 2025 MLS season with two very impressive wins. The energy and atmosphere as we beat Real Salt Lake and Diego Luna 4-0 on opening night was incredible. My friend is not a huge soccer fan but was wowed by Jamar Ricketts&rsquo; backflip celebration as we relentlessly pushed for more goals. Energy was high. Next, we went on the road to Sporting Kansas City and fought hard to beat them despite being down to just
 <strong>
  nine men
 </strong>
 after getting two cards.
</p>
<p>
 A fiery start to the season. Forty days came and went, and hopes were higher than ever. Playoffs? Pshh, people were talking about San Jose finishing as a top seed.
 <em>
  Very
 </em>
 uncharacteristic of the Quakes.
</p>
<p>
 Very uncharacteristic indeed, and the universe agreed. Following those games, San Jose lost three games on the trot. We barely escaped the next as well, sneaking out with a draw.
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps the magic sauce had run out. But in the next game, DC United came to San Jose. And we walloped them 6-1. Our biggest ever win in MLS history, thanks to a hattrick by new signing Josef Martinez. Stumbling out the kitchen, my dad was bewildered. He&rsquo;s so used to me wasting my Saturdays watching a losing soccer team. The Earthquakes were on the right side of that scoreline for once?
</p>
<p>
 Since then, we have continued having no semblance of consistency in our results. We win games we should have never. We lose games that should have been easy points. True, the new signings have worked in the attacking department; San Jose have scored the sixth (out of thirty teams) most goals in the league. But the defense remains as leaky as last year.
</p>
<p>
 Bruce Arena&rsquo;s tactics feel like a relic of the past at times. He waits until late in the game to make substitutions that could have otherwise made a difference earlier. He seems adamant on players he likes. Sometimes this works wonders; such as Beau Leroux, the local San Jose 22 year old who became a starting player early in the season after repeatedly great performances. Sometimes it leads to his lack of willingness to try new things out; like how Hernan Lopez was hardly given game time to gel with all the players before he was virtually ousted from the team.
</p>
<p>
 Bruce Arena is an experienced coach and understands far more about the game than most MLS pundits, players, or coaches. I don&rsquo;t claim to know how to fix the issues the team or entire San Jose Earthquakes organization has. I know Bruce has my full support and belief for as long as he coaches San Jose. But, one can&rsquo;t help but wonder whether his style of management and team setup is something that MLS has surpassed in recent years.
</p>
<p>
 Bruce Arena aside, one thing has become clear. Many people had mistaken San Jose for a championship level team at the start of the season. The Earthquakes are not one. The Earthquakes are also not a bottom dwelling side either. When you set aside the outlier (big wins and disastrous losses alike), the picture becomes clear. The Earthquakes are a middling team, and unless we show some fight in the remaining games, we&rsquo;ll only continue to regress to our very average form and play.

 A substitution taking place brought a moment to ponder San Jose&rsquo;s skyline. All of the tallest buildings in downtown are the same height - as if they were trimmed by a razor. Our airport is so close to downtown, which in turn leads to the intense building height restrictions. The tech capital of the world, defined by 300 foot stumps. Unlike the skyscraper-obsessed banking corporations of the world, tech in the bay has always preferred sprawling campuses and wide office buildings. Part of the blame lies with the scary fault lines near us. We don&rsquo;t build skywards in San Jose, damned by the earthquakes and their threats. I contemplated this as a plane gently glided onto the runway. A new Dallas player had glided onto the field as well.
</p>
<p>
 Earlier in the game, a long ball was played to Chicho Arango. To no success, but he gestured a thumbs up to the man who played it to him. A child beside me broke into a cry. It was a poor pass, but that was a harsh reaction I felt.
</p>
<p>
 Fifteen minutes after that, and the man who had misplaced the pass found a moment on the ball. It was Ian Harkes, and a brilliant curling shot by him nestled itself into the goal. In my pocket I felt my phone rumble; no doubt a notification from
 <a href="https://x.com/IanHarkesLover">
  @IanHarkesLover
 </a>
 who was probably freaking out. San Jose 1, Dallas none.
</p>
<p>
 It was a breezy summer&rsquo;s day at PayPal Park. The weather was as good as anyone could ask for. The Quakes were playing well, so things were good. It was 1-1 now, Dallas had scored a beautiful team goal. It wasn&rsquo;t over yet though.
</p>
<p>
 In the upper corner of the stadium, the lounge was buzzing. I had made my way up here from my seat around the 60th minute. Maybe it was the fact that I wasn&rsquo;t near that crying baby anymore. I felt great, and I felt like the Quakes would win.
</p>
<p>
 As the game inched closer to the end of the game, Dallas scored their second out of the blue.It was the 85th minute and we were losing 2-1. We were losing a game at home that we really should be winning.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, some fire and life seemed to enter the bodies of the San Jose players. They looked urgent for the first time all day. We took the game seriously for the first time all day. In less than a minute we countered. Josef Martinez found himself in a great spot as he scored a towering header. I was standing by LOBINA at this point. It was a great moment to be a part of, and everyone went crazy. Beer flew. I could sense that baby in the corner near my seat, faintly smiling.
</p>
<p>
 Minutes passed and it ended. The game ended in a tie, but we ended it celebrating as if we had won.

<h2>
 More Open Cup heartbreak
</h2>
<p>
 Let&rsquo;s have a sidebar about something that paints the storyline well for the upcoming last two games of the season. To what may be your surprise, the United States is host to the second oldest continuously held soccer competition in the world: the Open Cup. The idea behind the US Open Cup is that
 <em>
  any
 </em>
 organized soccer team can compete. Amateur teams and professional teams alike. There&rsquo;s no league format, it&rsquo;s just 90 minutes to win it. The perfect format for underdogs to rise up.
</p>
<p>
 Every year, I hope that the Earthquakes go far in the cup. I hold no hopes for the MLS Cup, but the Open Cup feels more realistic. Routinely, San Jose lose to the lower level teams from the USL and get knocked out of the cup. But this year, San Jose started by beating Sacramento Republic. We followed that up by beating the Portland Timbers in extra time. We had made the quarterfinals. We were playing at home to Austin FC, a game in which we fancied ourselves. It was a chance at a trophy.
</p>
<p>
 Not only did we dominate the majority of the chances in the game, Austin looked inept. They got lucky in the two goals they scored. Somehow, one of their players got away with a studs-out tackle on Cristian Espinoza:

 Austin took us to penalties as the game ended 2-2. And we blew it in the penalty shootout right after. Playing so well in the cup and still losing was devastating. I think this loss definitely led to a loss of morale in the team, and it took us a while to recollect it in the league in the weeks after. San Jose didn&rsquo;t win for another month.

 This is a good moment to take a look at the standings table for the western conference. There&rsquo;s 34 games played in the regular season (which you see on the GP column). San Jose is currently in a wild card spot with 38 points. We&rsquo;re in a race with Colorado, Dallas, Salt Lake City, and Houston. Portland and Austin should be safe, but they&rsquo;re tangentially still in the trenches with the rest of us. 7 teams, and only 4 playoff spots to go around.
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m now remembering the sub headline for this post. &ldquo;Assessing our playoff chances&rdquo;. More like guessing. Truthfully, I have no fucking idea what will happen in the last games. Three games ago, we lost at home to a 9th place St Louis team and were manhandled. Then, we beat top of the league San Diego away 1-0 while keeping a clean sheet. The chaos is why I support this team. I could say so many things; we should start Ousseni Bouda and Josef Martinez together, or that we need to switch to four in the back, or that we need to get better with headers off corners. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Win or lose, you can&rsquo;t expect anything from this team. That&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing.

 We play Thomas Muller and Vancouver away in the penultimate game. Then it&rsquo;s Austin at home in the last game. One win could be enough, since two draws probably won&rsquo;t get us enough points.
</p>
<p>
 Make sure to come to the final game on October 18th if you&rsquo;re free. It&rsquo;s decision day, where we play Austin FC and hope to exact revenge on them while qualifying for the playoffs. Maybe you&rsquo;ll get to watch Preston Judd play the hero in the season finale as we sneak into playoffs. Or maybe Bruce Arena is living his forty days, and San Jose truly is damned by our Earthquakes.

 Part of me posting this is just me getting the proverbial monkey of not posting since July off my back. It&rsquo;s now October. Work and graduate school have been taking lots of my time and patience, but this newsletter is on my mind nearly every day. I&rsquo;ve been working hard on new ideas for this newsletter. There are lots of really exciting drafts and projects in the pipeline, but some of them will take time. I want to meet people and then formulate my thoughts on it all. Some are creative writings, while some require research and feel more like real journalism. I mean,
 <em>
  this is very serious newsletter, you know?
 </em>
 I kid.
</p>
<p>
 This is me promising some consistency from October and onwards though. I understand soccer and the San Jose Earthquakes aren&rsquo;t an interest of everyone&rsquo;s, but I&rsquo;m certain at least one of the posts soon will be. Let me know if you enjoyed reading this one, especially if you don&rsquo;t regularly follow the Quakes. Posts about life in the south bay are coming back soon too.
</p>
<p>
 Thanks for reading.
