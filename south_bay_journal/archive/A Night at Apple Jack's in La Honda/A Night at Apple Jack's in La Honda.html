 It was a centaur bar supposedly. Simply put, it&rsquo;s where the centaurs hung out. This was their watering hole. Their territory, if you will. Away from the city lights and odd people who talked about things like the traffic and the news too much. A small town nestled in the valley between the ridges of the hills. A building of years gone by.
</p>
<p>
 The wood of the lodge was a brilliant brown, or maybe my senses had already lost me. I had been trudging through the forests and mountains for hours at this point. I wandered in, looking to quench my thirst.
</p>
<p>
 As I sat down, I noticed a centaur with a wonderfully rugged mane at the corner of the bar. She was an unassuming figure, but with fixated and piercing eyes that bored into me.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;How you end up here?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 My feet and my car, of course.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Well yes. But why?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 Can&rsquo;t a fox wander?
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Yes, what else is there to do?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 Drink, I said.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;You drove far?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 I made myself comfy on the stool and shrugged.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for a while.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 She nodded and lumbered to the other side of the bar to get me some kind of elixir. You&rsquo;ll like this, she said. A city fox like you. I nodded and then I drank and drank and drank.

 I was in Apple Jack&rsquo;s. A historic biker bar and inn located in the mountain town of La Honda.
</p>
<p>
 Here in the bay we often speak of micro-climates, but not of the &ldquo;micro-worlds&rdquo; that they envelop. We have such a diverse set of worlds around us, from the moody cliffs in Half Moon Bay, to the city life of San Francisco, to the sunny beaches and forests of Santa Cruz. Today, I had decided to tackle the Santa Cruz mountains - a place I seldom visit other than to hike. And make no mistakes, I was there to hike as well. But, it was to be just a part of the day.
</p>
<p>
 I started a little later than I would have liked, heading out around 2:30 PM. The drive to my first destination was to be over an hour long. The first forty minutes was through the city and concrete of the south bay, but eventually I was on scenic 280. Fun fact: Interstate 280 is officially designated as a scenic interstate - that&rsquo;s why there are no billboards on it, just gorgeous hillside views.
</p>
<p>
 Soon, I was taking the exit for Sand Hill Road near rich Atherton and Woodside. The elevation rises quickly as you drive into the rural parts of San Mateo County. The red barn shortly off of Sand Hill Road almost stands to signify the change in area and landscape.
</p>
<p>
 The roads up in the mountains are gorgeous to drive, namely highways 84 and 35 in that area. An acquaintance of mine is a big car nut, and he told me that he often drives up around this area to get to Pescadero. There&rsquo;s lots of car and bike meet ups in that general area, but even otherwise I don&rsquo;t blame him. The twists and turns along with the corners make it a lovely place to drive - and that&rsquo;s not even considering the picturesque views.
</p>
<p>
 The views are spectacular around this area in general - on either side. Looking from any high point westward gives you unfiltered views of the Pacific Ocean, while the eastward direction can offer views showcasing the vastness of the South Bay concrete jungle. And when there&rsquo;s no grand view, you get treated to the intimate enclosures of Santa Cruz forest.
</p>
<p>
 I started off the hiking by stopping at the La Honda Open Space Preserve. As the name suggests, it&rsquo;s a large protected open space area. There&rsquo;s many similarly protected places throughout the bay around us, thanks namely to two organizations. POST (Peninsula Open Space Trust) has done a wonderful job of preserving so much land around us, alongside Midpeninsula Regional Open Space (commonly referred to as just Midpen). These two organizations work together in order to preserve much of the incredible natural beauty we have here, from the valley to the beach, free of charge! POST is a nonprofit that primarily works on fundraising for acquiring land for public uses and recreation along with land restoration, whereas Midpen works as a public agency that advocates and supports the public and open green spaces from San Mateo to Santa Clara to Santa Cruz County. Midpen is even governed by a board of directors that have open meetings which the public can attend!

 La Honda Open Space Preserve in particular is one of their bigger local success stories, a former grasslands area simply for cattle ranching that was to be developed. POST acquired the land and sold it Midpen after - and today there&rsquo;s are miles and miles of trails alongside open hills, wooded valleys, and happy cattle.
</p>
<p>
 I got out of my car to a gentle breeze and clear skies. The luscious and sweeping hills in every direction make you feel like you&rsquo;ve gone through a portal. I can&rsquo;t believe I was in San Jose just an hour ago.

 The Grasshopper Trail meandered between two hills, and at one vista point there were two benches, perfect for taking in the grand view. I admired some of the cattle, seemingly befuddled at the site of a straggling late day hiker like me. The trail took a downwards turn afterwards, towards Harrington Creek. A herd of cows almost seemed to be defending the creek as I got close, but they were more than happy to let me walk past them all on the trail. The creek was flowing strongly, so I was able to  freshen up before heading back to my car. I had one more park to go to, and I happily hummed songs to the cows before I left them. An hour and a half well spent.

 The next spot I drove on to was Sam McDonald State Park - just nine minutes south on the main La Honda Road. Just those few minutes makes a world of difference though. Going downhill, the landscape changes from open rolling hills to heavily forested woodlands. Redwoods and Douglas Firs and Pine trees dominate. The ground is littered in pinecones and lichen and moss.
</p>
<p>
 Only one car stood in the otherwise desolate nook of a parking lot. As I parked some spots beside it, a couple emerged out the forest. I was glad to find out that they lived right around the area, on Skyline Boulevard. They told me of the loop trail and said it was teeming with life today. Excited, I set off.
</p>
<p>
 Realizing the sun set wasn&rsquo;t far off, I embarked to do the hike of four miles in about an hour. The incline was proving to be intense quickly, and for some reason I decided to run through large swaths of the trail. Tired just five minutes in, I stopped to take in the thick redwood forest around me. Was I in Humboldt County again?

<p>
 The couple had been right. Quickly, I spotted multiple banana slugs sludging through the trails. I was transported to the past instantly, to science camp in elementary school. Who remembers kissing a banana slug at camp? I know I do; I had to get that badge! Gallivanting through the trail, I slowly also realized the salamanders were out. Realizing I should be wary as I trudged through the forest, I slowed down to avoid crushing any of the forest critters.
</p>
<p>
 Eventually, my legs seemed to be on the losing end of the battle with the elevation. I grew more and more exhausted, and desperately checked my maps to locate the path back. It would get oh so close to the car, only to turn back up a mountain before looping in to the parking lot for real.
</p>
<p>
 Right foot. Left foot. Right foot. Left foot.
</p>
<p>
 I remembered a summer&rsquo;s day not long ago where I hiked many magnitudes longer in the mountains. I could do it, I knew I could. I just had to buckle down and get over my tired legs. As if an omniscient and omnipotent being had heard me, the trail magically began to go downhill.
</p>
<p>
 Within an hour and a half, I was back at my car. It was still light out. I got in my car, and I headed to my final destination of the day: Apple Jack&rsquo;s. I had made it. And I could use a cold beverage.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 It was a
 <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=126672">
  historic establishment
 </a>
 - no doubt. I sat alone, confined in my bubble of the only fox. When I came in, only the bartender and one man in the corner were present. The building was deceptively big on the inside, housing pool tables, an open area for dancing, some regular tables, a jukebox, and the bar itself. Online, Apple Jack&rsquo;s claims to be a roadhouse rather than a dive bar. And not only does it look like a roadhouse, but it captures the atmosphere of one in it&rsquo;s own secluded and unique style.
</p>
<p>
 The bartender asks me where I came from, and I tell her San Jose. She tells me she goes down to the city every so often for things. I guess I come up here to the mountains for things too. I order a beer, and ask her about herself. She&rsquo;s been living in La Honda her whole life, and she loves it. I take my beer, and finally relax, after the hours of trudging.
</p>
<p>
 As I take in the air of the bar, the backdrop in front of me comes into focus. There&rsquo;s stickers and signs and small notes everywhere. Some in particular catch my eye. One says &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re offended by anything you hear, let us know so we can laugh at it&rdquo;. Another simply states &ldquo;Fuck Joe Biden&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m beginning to see where those reviews about Apple Jack&rsquo;s being potentially conservative and racist were coming from.
</p>
<p>
 As I look around I&rsquo;m profoundly aware for the first time that everyone else in the bar is white. Uneasy for a moment, I think about my interaction with the bartender. She had been nice enough, right?
</p>
<p>
 I look up and signal for another beer, another 805. She glides over and fills it up, but hardly utters a word while doing so. She asks me if I&rsquo;d like a lime, and I oblige. Was there a reason she hadn&rsquo;t said a word to me otherwise? I wave the thought away, and ponder some more signs.

 I had been overhearing the conversation happening in the bar for some time now. The town was small, less than a thousand people. Everyone knew each other and each other&rsquo;s familys very well it seemed. A couple came, and someone who seemed to be the bartender&rsquo;s boyfriend. I heard them chatter about a woman named Sarah, who was seemingly on the verge of being banned from the bar. She was a drunk, and apparently not a fun one. I thought, where else is a drunk meant to go but the bar?
</p>
<p>
 I swing wildly between wanting the big city life sometimes, and the small town life sometimes. It was refreshing to hear of what seemed to be an incredibly tight and close community in town. I&rsquo;m sure there are its drawbacks, but paradoxically, it seems that it may be easier to find community in smaller towns. Or perhaps this was only true of some groups.
</p>
<p>
 Apple Jack&rsquo;s was livening up a little now. I swiveled in my chair, and noticed license plates hung up on the bar from
 <em>
  every
 </em>
 state in the country. Two guys were playing an animated game of pool by the corner of the large wooden rooms. I watched them briefly, and realized how horrid my pool skills were in comparison.
</p>
<p>
 A couple old horses rocked up to the bar in the moments following. Everyone says hi and addresses them by name but myself, the lone out-of-towner. They sat by the bar, and ordered their drinks. After five minutes, one of the two men meets eyes with me, and pulls his barstool closer. I say cheers, and we begin talking.
</p>
<p>
 He had come to La Honda some twenty-six years ago from Illinois, and was a self proclaimed conspiracy nut. He lived by himself in town, and seemed to know the local area as well as a blacksmith could know his anvil. We shared stories of our lives, evidently vastly different. Now, I don&rsquo;t think he was generally the archetype of person that I would necessarily get along with. But&hellip; Inexplicably. Puzzlingly. Mysteriously. Unfathomably. I did. I totally did.
</p>
<p>
 You know what vastly different people let you do? They let you examine your beliefs and perspectives but anew. They don&rsquo;t necessarily change them, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m saying at all. But they let you think about yourself in relation to the world yet again, like you haven&rsquo;t in a while. Maybe you really haven&rsquo;t thought about yourself in a while. I know I go days without thinking about myself and my virtues all the time.
</p>
<p>
 My new short-lived friend was an anti-vaxxer. Insanity, yes I know. A slippery slope for a whole slate of incongruent beliefs. But, he wasn&rsquo;t looking to yell or argue at me. He was concerned that I had gotten four of them. He looked to me in a way as if to say, I&rsquo;m so sorry but based on what I believe and think, you shouldn&rsquo;t have. I was glad to let him know that I didn&rsquo;t regret my decision in the slightest, and I would do it again. He didn&rsquo;t push me further. He said he would let his kids get them, if he had any that is. That was that. He bought me a beer, and now began talking about psychedelic experiments on monkeys at Stanford. Those monkeys had probably seen all kinds of things.
</p>
<p>
 He departed after giving me a tight hug, not before he proclaimed me a friend of his.
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps it&rsquo;s a trite observation, but we are all truly so much more similar than we are different. We all care for one another, we all want the best for humanity, and we want to live nice lives. That&rsquo;s a thought to keep in mind, reader. Take my words - and take anyone&rsquo;s words - for the best they are. See the best in people. From San Jose to La Honda.
</p>
<p>
 As I scarfed down what I knew would be my last beer of the night, a trio of men came in. It&rsquo;s nice to see people coming into bars to join you whenever, but I was even happier to see them since they were all Latino. They told me they worked around town, and they loved it out here. We made a toast and they told me to come again, on a weekend day next time.
</p>
<p>
 From a relatively quiet first few hours, the night had certainly picked up for me. Two pleasant interactions with two groups of people who were also just looking to unwind and talk.

 Outside, the night had taken over. As I left, I noticed the statue of a bearded mountain man that my new friend from earlier had told me about. Apparently, a local artist made them out of scrap metal and leftover nails/bolts. On a large wooden chair on the other side of the door, a man smoked away.
</p>
<p>
 I watched the statue alone for a little, admiring the craftsmanship that had most definitely gone into making him. As I stared into his eyes, I saw him begin to move. He was morphing into a larger figure, and stood in front of me to say something. I stood up too straight too. He began talking. I knew it, it was the banana slug from before. He had crawled on over from the forest to Apple Jack&rsquo;s, to animate the statue.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said to me.
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Thanks for not stomping on me.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; I said. What had been in my beer?
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been stepped all over haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
 &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Just stay off the trail with all the giants and you&rsquo;ll be fine&rdquo; he said.

 I nodded, and I took a seat to sober up. It had been a long day. I got up, and I drove through the dark and winding mountain roads to go home. I wonder if I&rsquo;ll ever be back at Apple Jack&rsquo;s.

 Hope you enjoyed this; for whatever reason it took me a very long time to sum up my thoughts on this day trip. This post is a slight change in style from my regular posts, so please let me know if you enjoyed it in the comments, or if you have any thoughts! I have a couple more photos from this particular day that I think are quite nice - I'll share them below.
</p>
<p>
 Side note, hope you had a nice Easter and 4/20. Ideally I'll be posting this Friday again, focusing on south bay history instead this time. See you then!
