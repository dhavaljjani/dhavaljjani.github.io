 November was a testing month. And so I looked to the skies, and there I found the cosmos.

 Driving on 237 and 101 can be a bit of a trip. Not because of the way you lose your mind in the traffic, but rather the fact that there is such a clear divide in development and space visible while driving them. There&rsquo;s history there. 101 is bayshore after all. Areas south of it are like any other in the south bay, while the northern side faces the bay itself, and in turn has wildly differing land uses. Not too long ago, that area by the shores was just farmlands and grasslands that slowly descended into the bay.

 Today, there exists a collection of seemingly random and chaotic land uses, like a hectic multiplayer minecraft world:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  <p>
   A system of salt ponds, sloughs, and creeks that are diverted and sort water thanks to a large system of levees and embankments. Some of the levees have trails you can walk, and
   <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Drawbridge,+Fremont,+CA+94538/@37.4663256,-121.9955596">
    some have inaccessible ghost towns of the past.
   </a>
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Multiple large golf courses, many built on reclaimed landfills. And a TopGolf driving range, if the regular golf courses weren&rsquo;t enough.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Expansive bayside recreational parks, also often on reclaimed landfills. Some of the more fun places. Shoreline, Bedwell, Baylands, Ravenswood, there&rsquo;s a ton.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Massive tech offices for companies worth billions of dollars. Google, Meta, Amazon, LinkedIn, all the ones you&rsquo;d expect.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   VTA&rsquo;s orange line which meanders through the office parks here instead of residential areas - from the Crossman station to the Bayshore station. Well, at least everyone uses it to get to work, right? Not that either; the stations here have some of the lowest ridership out of any in the VTA light rail system. Just a thought, but having rail a bit further south in Sunnyvale on El Camino Real would be so much better. I could go to my family dentist and get to all the other cool stuff on that road so easily. Tons of people live there too. Alas.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Padel facilities (I&rsquo;ve driven by multiple). It&rsquo;s the newest racquet ball sport sweeping the nation. Yeah, I guess it&rsquo;s not even pickleball now.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Finally, multiple federal government agencies with buildings and facilities behind gates shrouded in mystery&hellip;
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Now that last one especially sticks out. Lockheed Martin is one of the federal actors here. Their gated North Sunnyvale facility is over 311 acres, pushed right up against Moffett Field.
</p>
<p>
 And there&rsquo;s NASA on the other side. One of the universally-loved federal agencies we have. Only a couple others spring to my mind. Now I&rsquo;ve never been to Moffett Field. But for many people, it&rsquo;s the reason that they and their families are here in the bay in the first place.
</p>
<p>
 The NASA Ames center visitor center is also puzzlingly at the Chabot Space Center in Oakland, instead of like.. at the AMES center in Moffett Field itself. Weird. I actually have been to the Chabot Space Center, but as a kid. I remember being wowed at the space exhibits. I also remember that it blew my mind when they took a picture of me, and they would just &ldquo;email&rdquo; it to me if I typed my email address in. I had only gotten my first email recently, then. We have come so far.

<p>
 But I still wanted to see it. Their other public facilities on site include a small NASA Visitor Store, and a cafeteria-esque eatery and bar dubbed the SpaceBar. Scouring the internet, I found that it&rsquo;s not all that uncommon for NASA and Moffett Field workers to frequent it during the day at work, and stick around after for drinks.
</p>
<p>
 A bar at a federal facility potentially frequented by NASA engineers? Yeah, cue the title card.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 There&rsquo;s something about listening to music alone. I&rsquo;m in my car driving north on Moffett Boulevard, crooning alongside the song poorly. My voice doesn&rsquo;t matter. Not a fun thought. The song paces up, and the thoughts leave.
</p>
<p>
 Night&rsquo;s fallen already, or at least the dark has. Work&rsquo;s over, and I rest knowing it&rsquo;s behind me for the day. But I don&rsquo;t want to be at home or with anyone I know.
</p>
<p>
 The AMES Center is one of only ten NASA field centers located across the country. Each one specializes in particular domain. At the AMES center, the focus is on aeronautics, astrobiology, supercomputing, and similar R&amp;D. They all facilitate the function of NASA, the Air Force, and countless other agencies. The USGS has a building. The Marine Corps uses facilites here. US Fish and Wildlife Service owns a ton of land here.
</p>
<p>
 And like I said, NASA only has ten of these centers across the country. Why here?It was 1939, and it was none other than famous pilot Charles Lindbergh and his commitee who had chosen Mountain View. And out of 50 final cities, they chose Mountain View due to ease of access for the Army, who had a training base nearby already.
</p>
<p>
 In the years since, NASA has conducted some very valuable research here. The wind tunnel allows them to simulate intense supersonic flight. Lunar samples were first inspected here, when Apollo 11 returned. They sent the Galileo probe, the first object to ever enter Jupiter&rsquo;s atmosphere. They built the premier supercomputer for intense aerospace calculations.
</p>
<p>
 Now, I come to the intersection of Moffett Boulevard and R.T. Jones Road. Besides me, a man in a car who certainly has some kind of clearance. He&rsquo;s got the outfit. He drives straight with conviction. I drive, but with slight apprehension.
</p>
<p>
 I roll up to the NASA front gate, and pull my window down for the guys at the gate. He asks for ID and where I&rsquo;m headed. The SpaceBar it is. We get into some words about when it closes; he insists to me that it already did.
</p>
<p>
 Now I ask an armed military officer if he&rsquo;s ever even heard of the internet. The times are listed there. And I checked.
</p>
<p>
 Not very tactful. I can be a dick. I come nicer, and he lets me through, his brows thoroughly furrowed.

<p>
 The first thing you see as you drive in is a scaled model of a space shuttle bearing the plaque for the search center. Just plain cool. The energy inside is different though. Being in a place that requires ID feels some kind of way, and this wasn&rsquo;t a club or work or something. Moffett Field looks like what I expect a traditional military base to look like. Large open lawn in the middle. Symmetrical roads on either side. Some large roundabouts for them.
</p>
<p>
 The music gets turned down now.
</p>
<p>
 I park in an empty lot, still unsure of myself. It&rsquo;s quiet. Walking around, the entrance of the SpaceBar is not outwardly visible or obvious. Intermittent security cars driving around make me tense, for a reason I can&rsquo;t quite articulate to myself.

<p>
 &ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;, I asked myself. I walk a little and turn after the equivalent of a military-base block, facing the unfathomably big Hangar 1. Hangar One is a facility for blimps. Yes, blimps. It can house
 <em>

 . It is makes-you-question-your-eyesight-and-human-perception-ly big in person. An unavoidable sight if you&rsquo;re anywhere in the bay with a view. It&rsquo;s my point of reference every time I&rsquo;m on top of Mission Peak. The hangar is so big that clouds can
 <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/u-s-naval-air-station-sunnyvale-california-historic-district.htm">
  form inside it.
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m losing track of myself. I see some lights finally, and zombie toward it like would a moth. There&rsquo;s an outdoor seating area, but it&rsquo;s too cold to sit out. Tables empty.
</p>
<p>
 I open the door and step into the SpaceBar.
</p>
<p>
 It&rsquo;s mostly empty inside too. Mondays must be quiet days at the SpaceBar. It&rsquo;s at this point that I must confess that I tried to come here the Wednesday before. It had been (understandably) closed since it was the day before Thanksgiving. However, I had kind of gotten this idea that it&rsquo;s not commonly visited as a bar by people not working there. It&rsquo;s a place for grub for people working in the area (federal/air-force people largely) during the day, and for local tourists to make weekend-trips and see NASA stuff and eat some fat burgers.
</p>
<p>
 I was still hungover from a disastrous night last week. I needed to be sensible. I decide to treat it less as a bar, and more like a cafeteria. I ordered the vegetarian burger on their website. The bar itself is in the corner, with no chairs. More suprisingly though; no bartender too. I meet eyes with a guy in the back of the kitchen on the other side. He comes through and gives me a pour.

 The Foreteller it was, a dark lager from San Luis Obispo. Good town to visit, even better town for beer I guess.
</p>
<p>
 I went to one of the many tables, and sat back down. Two older men talked on a table behind me. About their sons and daughters. Where their work used to be. And where their work was now. The burger was good, the jalapenos surprisingly slightly spicy. I enjoyed it. I washed it down with the prophetic beer.

 The Patriots were playing the Giants on TV. The Patriots were mostly the only ones playing. At the bar, a couple guys had come in and the bartender was back too. I joined them, intermittently saying things. I don&rsquo;t speak much.
</p>
<p>
 Conversation was slow. There were concerns, of course there were. People work hard at their jobs in research, in medical work, in national security, in weather forecasting, in a million other things that others depend on. And war-hungry Pete Hegseth is in the news destroying it all. The crowd despises him too, and I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised.
</p>
<p>
 They&rsquo;re talking about Artemis, NASA&rsquo;s mission coming up. In February, we&rsquo;re going to the moon again, albeit with a completely different goal and a totally different geopolitical landscape in the world. Amidst the science-denialism of the current president and admin. Amidst the lack of education in them. Amidst the lack of federal excitement for space, other than by a corrupted racist billionaire in Elon Musk. Just exploration fueled by exploitation without any kind of empathy.
</p>
<p>
 Humans, we shoot for the stars and the cosmos because we&rsquo;re curious to see everything out there. Not because we gave up down here. We seek all the light out there. We seek to learn about our place in them. That&rsquo;s what Artemis is about, and we should be seeking them. The moon, Mars, and past it all. I want the ones who care, and who see it that way to be spearheading efforts, not Musk and his cronies.

<p>
 At Hodge Park recently, a friend and I attended a SJ Astronomical Association star gazing meeting. Enthusiasts and engineers and guys with telescopes all crazier than the last were present. My old binoculars were no match. Using a friendly man&rsquo;s telescope, we see Saturn and we see Pleiades. The sisters of the sky, shining together.
</p>
<p>
 But perhaps the best part was the people who were sharing the knowledge and letting us all see. It wasn&rsquo;t megalomaniacs. It wasn&rsquo;t anyone pushing any agenda. It wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;spend X dollars to use my telescope&rdquo;. It was, here take a look at something incredible. The pursuit of the stars and science should be accessible to us all, but it should still not be seen as better than or more important than life on Earth.

 vision. Along with its somehow functioning telemetry devices; it carries with it memories of home. The Golden Record on it aims to represent the wide tapestry of human culture and knowledge as succinctly and simply as it can. It&rsquo;s like the momentos and souvenirs and papers and pieces of things you keep in your drawers forever. Memories of your past. The Voyager is memories of
 <em>
  our collective past
 </em>
 .
</p>
<p>
 I couldn&rsquo;t tell you the speed at which I fly away from my family and friends. Maybe it&rsquo;s something similar. The days go by and the distance grows faster and faster. I carry past memories of better moments too.
</p>
<p>
 Many people say the Voyager is no longer retrievable by humans anymore. It&rsquo;s too far. Humans as a collective, we would need to make a herculean jump in terms of our rocket and energy capabilities (or so I read online). Some of my life feels the same way. I hope the herculean effort required by me will somehow be easy.

 Hours passed, and maybe days. I was back home. I run into someone in the kitchen. It&rsquo;s almost as crowded as the bar here. Because it&rsquo;s so quiet. I see the light that&rsquo;s in her eyes. Through the rocks and through the asteroids and through the dinners and through the stars. I see her light, and she sees mine. We speak. I speak.

 Let me say a word about the Earthquakes season, which ended in October. I previewed the exciting end of the season in the last post. If you recall: In order to make playoffs, we needed to win the final game of the season and needed other results around the league to go our way. Specifically, beat Austin ourselves, and hope two of the following happen:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  <p>
   FC Dallas lose away against Vancouver
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Salt Lake City lose away against St Louis
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
   Colorado at least tie if not win at home against LAFC
  </p>
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 I felt good about at least two of those happening. Vancouver would win, and so would either St Louis or Vancouver. It was our part I wasn&rsquo;t sure about. I rocked up to the game, missing out on La Maquina, but high in spirits with my partner. We were going to fly into the fucking playoffs.
</p>
<p>
 Seems like the team had other intentions. Looked like my high school team out there in the first ten. Headless. Yelling. Looking for a leader. Our heads went down as we went down 1-0 from a deflected goal. At halftime, I had all but lost hope. I checked the results from other games in the league, which were also nearly all going the wrong way.
</p>
<p>
 But in the second half, we made some personnel changes. Preston Judd, Jack Skahan, and Niko Tsakiris were on. We wanted to find a win somehow. We began to look alive, and Skahan found some space on the wings. He crosses it and 74&rdquo; Josef heads it in and it&rsquo;s level. Everyone&rsquo;s celebrating. Still celebrating. For minutes. Now, we get a free kick. Niko Tsakiris steps up, and I have a feeling. 77&rdquo; Niko Tsakiris curls it in with his left foot, sending San Jose to it&rsquo;s feet. We&rsquo;re winning. And we negotiate the next twenty minutes.
</p>
<p>
 On my phone, I check the scores of the other games. Teams are letting us down. We&rsquo;re still below the magic playoff line. Our game ends, San Jose have won 2-1. Elsewhere, Salt Lake City have scored to tie it up. If they score again and win, we make playoffs. The giant screen at the stadium puts the Real Salt Lake-St Louis game on live.

 Our players sat on the grass, and watched the big screen along with us all. As Salt Lake failed to score, our season ended there.
</p>
<p>
 So all in all, a season that was twenty points better than last season but ended the same way: no post-season. Since the season ended there&rsquo;s been a whole another slew of offseason moves by us. Some are as perplexing as ever. I&rsquo;ll be writing about that before the MLS season starts later next year.

 I haven&rsquo;t been consistent with the posting here at all lately. I have continued writing, and I have multiple posts about different topics and events largely written out, but I&rsquo;m struggling to finish a lot of them. Part of it is that I am occupied with so much in life and I am truly running on fumes. I work full time, commute full time, attend graduate  school outside of work, and try to fit in time for everything else in between. Lots of my writing juices have been taken up by academic work, which may also be poorly written. I make promises of good writing to no one.

 December 4th marked a year since
 <a href="https://southbayjournal.substack.com/p/what-is-this-substack?r=2cslop">
  the first post
 </a>
 was made on this substack. On the South Bay Journal. To anyone who continues to read these words, including these very ones, I am thankful beyond measure. Next year, I hope to finally start interviewing people. Conversations with people I admire
 , in places around the bay. Going to new places in the bay, sharing new stories of other people and my own
 . Of different communities and subcultures. Of the absurd life we live these days. Journalists, artists, athletes, musicians, writers, educators, and any other people with stories in the area. In San Jose or the east bay or up the peninsula. No matter the size of your impact or how long your journey has been. I write to share my thoughts, but I know others around me have even more to share and I want to meet them and talk to them and rage with them and laugh with them and learn with them. Reach out to me.

<p>
 I&rsquo;m not so good at the substack game, but I know how this works. You have to ride the waves of more views and higher readership. Can&rsquo;t waste them when they come. And they don&rsquo;t come out of nowhere. Consistent posting is key next year. Just doing more in 2026. Hopefully, you&rsquo;ll be able to read the South Bay Journal on my website soon as well.

 Stay safe in the ongoing winds and rains. Thank you for reading. Happy holidays.
