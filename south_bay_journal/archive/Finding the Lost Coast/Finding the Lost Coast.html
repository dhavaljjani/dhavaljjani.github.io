 Okay, this post isn’t about the South Bay. It’s not even about a place close by to be honest. But please, indulge me. For about four days and three nights, a little before New Years, I (along with my wonderful partner) ventured to somewhere about six hours north of San Jose: Humboldt County.
</p>
<p>
 Commonly referred to by people as the “lost coast”; it’s not hard to see why. The coastal region of Northern California has no large mega city, most industries other than timber, agriculture, and tourism have left (
 <a href="https://calmatters.org/economy/2023/02/emerald-triangle-cannabis-workers/">
  the cannabis industry has seemingly been killed by legalization
 </a>
 ), and the beaches (while just as stunning if not more) are virtually unknown compared to their SoCal counterparts. A general lack of development here has been caused by the difficult terrain, lack of economic opportunities, and harsh rainy season. Eureka is the biggest city in the area, but with only 26 thousand (strong I assume). Other than that, there are only three cities with more than ten thousand people: Arcata, McKinleyville, and Fortuna, in that order. And I can tell you, when people think of the Pacific Northwest they think of Seattle or Portland, not Fortuna. Yeah, the lost coast.
</p>
<p>
 The drive up there was long, wet, and dark. Meandering through Stockton and San Joaquin County, and then up Interstate 5 to Williams (shoutout Granzella’s) past Sacramento. Turning west, you drive by the imaginatively named Lake County, and then north to Mendocino County. Finally, there’s Humboldt County. You can tell you’re there when the downpour begins and your windshield wipers become necessary.

 I had been wanting to go see the redwoods for months. I’ve driven through the area with family a few times but never actually properly stopped by, other than to see a couple big ones. It really felt like the trees were calling for me again though.
</p>
<p>
 The giant redwoods are
 <a href="http://famousredwoods.com/">
  the most massive beings on our planet
 </a>
 . No, really. They are also some of the oldest beings, along with being some of the tallest trees in the world. In fact, the tallest tree in the world is located in the Redwood National Park, about forty minutes north of Eureka. Named
 <em>
  Hyperion
 </em>
 , its location is hidden for it’s safety. Sure, you can spend some time sleuthing the internet and find the coordinates, but it’s best we keep our trivial human desires at bay. These trees deserve our respect.
</p>
<p>
 There’s something about walking underneath the forest of redwoods that’s absolutely unbelievable. For a quick second, imagine an ant walking around a garden, surrounded by massive grass blades, flowers, and shrubs. They would form a canopy that would keep the ant from ever seeing anything else above. That’s a bit of the feeling you get when you stand below the redwoods. Their massive scale cannot be overstated, they
 <strong>
  will
 </strong>
 make you feel small. But, they will also provide you with so much shade and with the beautiful redwood cones that adorn the ground. The forest contains so much life, thanks to the abundant rain and the protection of the trees. In a way, they are the keepers of the forest.
</p>
<p>
 We ventured to Humboldt State Park, which is arguably just as spectacular as the national park further north. The “Avenue of Giants” contains dozens of famous trees along with a scenic auto tour, which we sadly couldn’t do all of due to the road closure. We did get to see the Founder’s Tree, which at some point was considered the tallest tree in the world. Nearby, we saw the Dyerville Giant, a fallen behemoth of a tree. The standing redwoods are stunningly impressive, but some of the fallen trees doubly so. Still standing taller than any humans, they lie on the forest floor in all their glorious size. It was darkening and we got to see the roots of the giant facing us. It’s as if a gentle monster is looking at you.

 Think of this as the part in a textbook from when you were a kid where some zany character named Milton the Math Monkey would ask you to do an experiment. I miss those fun little sections. Milton (aka myself) is asking you to guess how tall the trees in NorCal are, and we’ll measure a tree for the sake of visualization. I’ve been inspired by the famousredwoods website. Here’s a kind of big redwood I took a picture of here in the bay; how tall do you think it is?

 Milton says, “let’s measure it!”. We’ll be using some good old trigonometry. After doing some terribly messy work, I realized we could measure one with a short formula.
</p>
<p>
 So, if you imagine yourself in front of a tree, you can use the distance you are from the tree being measured, and the height of your eyeline. The bottom line is that we can estimate the total height of the tree with the following:
</p>
<div class="latex-rendered">
</div>
<p>
 The variable
 <em>
  a
 </em>
 represents the height of my eyeline,
 <em>
  d
 </em>
 is the distance I am from the tree, and theta is the angle created by the horizontal line from my eyeline and the line created from my eyes to the tippy top of the tree.
</p>
<p>
 So, I was about 90 feet away from the pictured tree. My eyes sit roughly about 5.65 feet from the ground. The angle created to the top of the tree I would guesstimate as ~55 degrees. Using our formula, Milton gets the height of our lovely tree as about 134 feet. That makes sense, good work Milton!
</p>
<p>
 Wanna know the real kicker? The redwoods in Humboldt and in the parks commonly reach over 300 feet, with many recording above 350 feet as well. That is over double the pictured redwood (which is a decently big tree to its credit). Absolutely ridiculous.
</p>
<div>
 <hr/>
</div>
<p>
 We can talk about the redwoods all day, but there’s also the “coast” part of the lost coast. And it is equally incredible. We went to a small town named Trinidad, located on a peninsula that juts out, some twenty minutes north of Eureka. The town has a population of 311, and driving or walking by you get the idea that people who live here have been doing so for decades. There seemed to be a couple small cafes on one street, but we didn’t stop for food. There was even a seafood restaurant right by the pier. But, we wanted to see the beach and cliffside, and of course, the Trinidad Lighthouse.
</p>
<p>
 History time! The Trinidad Head Lighthouse was first lit up all the way back in 1871, along with a small keeper’s house. It lies on the Trinidad Head, a large domed rock/mountain off the peninsula, which you can hike all around! In 1914 (same year as when our favorite new theater was built!), a
 <a href="https://www.trinidad-ca.com/discover/lighthouses.html">
  huge wave struck the land and lighthouse here
 </a>
 , and it’s estimated to be the largest rogue wave to ever strike the American west coast, based on the lighthouse keeper’s notes. At least 175 feet tall, and perhaps closer to 200 or above.
</p>
<p>
 Alas, the day we were there, the Trinidad Head lighthouse trails were closed due to recent heavy rain. It’s okay, at least we got to see the Trinidad Memorial Lighthouse, which was near the pier.

 We did, however, do some hiking on the Trinidad Head regardless. It was a damp day with the weather app constantly threatening upcoming rain, which was slightly worrying. But, we set out to hike, and hike we did. The trails were slightly steep, but we were up to the challenge. They become more dense with trees and bushes and various fauna, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. There were parts where the trail would be completely enveloped in the vegetation, and I had a vague feeling of being a hobbit.

 There were some spurs that tailed off to the edges of the cliffs, which had vast expansive views of the ocean and Trinidad. Cold misty air enveloped us as we stood on the trails at the edge. The only sounds were the waves crashing into rocks, and our chatter as we started the hike down. Soon, the sound of a light drizzle took over. We narrowly avoided the heavy rain as we reached our car again, parked by the pier.

 Now, about the town of Arcata, where we spent the majority of our time. Honestly, I cannot understate how much I loved Arcata. I may or may not have already looked at apartments in the area, just for fun.
</p>
<p>
 The Arcata Plaza in the center of town was so wonderful. The town is mostly gridded up, and has a whole block in the middle dedicated to a cute symmetrical park with walkways, green grass, and benches…that’s what it’s all about. Surrounding the park plaza was an assortment of stores, cafes, and bars. Including one mushroom cafe? There’s some zany stuff in Arcata, and I’ll get back to that in a bit.
</p>
<p>
 There were also barely any vacant lots. Tons of people were walking around with every new person friendlier than the last. The first morning we walked around, it was Saturday, which meant it was the Farmer’s market too. Tents were organized around the Aracata Plaza square and people were selling produce, clothing, jewelry, and just miscellaneous items. It was lively. We stopped by one stand, where a nice gentleman was selling homemade honey mead. It was a rich golden color, and after talking to him, we tried some out. It was SO good. It was sweet in a nectary way, and felt so smooth to drink. I was so sad to hear that they took cash only, because I had no cash at that very moment. But on the other hand, now I know I have to go back for the honey mead some day.
</p>
<p>
 After getting lunch at Cafe Brio, we walked around for an hour or so. Meandering through thrift stores and small boutiques was really enjoyable, especially because so many of them seemed to be owned by locals or families rather than some faceless corporations. Walking through the sidewalks of the town in general left me with a warm cozy feeling, despite the drizzling rain.
</p>
<p>
 I think another reason Arcata appealed so much to me was the slightly zany or wacky art and stores everywhere. It fully feels like a place that embraces how “weird” it is, and I love that. Seeing smaller towns that are so personifiable and progressive at the same time is really lovely. I’m guessing that it’s partly due to the fact that Arcata houses the Cal Poly Humboldt campus, and the prevalence of legal cannabis in the area. Younger people always increase the weirdness and progressiveness of an area, in a great way. I felt sweet and kind energy radiated at me from most people we encountered, which goes a long way in how a place feels.

<p>
 A couple blocks from the plaza, we found the Minor Theater. The second oldest specifically meant for
 <strong>
  movie
 </strong>
 theater in the country, it’s been a staple of the community in Arcata since 1914. The theater has a light blue exterior and signage in gorgeous golden and black. I was attracted to the architecture, and then we noticed they were showing
 <em>
  Nosferatu
 </em>
 that day. So, we walked over and watched it later that night, at the 6:30 pm showing, and it was a great time. The movie was it’s own increbile and harrowing thing too, but I think I may make a separate post about that.
</p>
<p>
 As we left the Minor Theater at night, the rains had stopped. There were people walking all around, and you would not have thought you were in a town of just some sixteen thousand people. We walked by numerous bars, looking to pick the perfect one. Some seemed livelier than others, while some seemed like local hang out spots. Finally, after walking several blocks south away from the plaza, we arrived at Richard’s Goat Tavern. The bar had been labeled LGBT-friendly online, and as a fun spot to dance and meet people.
</p>
<p>
 “It’s the gayest place in town!”, one of the locals we met confirmed to us. Now, that’s how you know it’s a good spot.
</p>
<p>
 We counted about 23 goats in some form on the walls of the bar, whether as statues or in paintings or even taxidermied. I’m sure we missed some, we had both had a drink in us at this point too. I had perhaps the worst cocktail I had ever tried, but maybe it was just me. I’m not a fan of warm drinks in general, least of all ones that remind me of medicine I had as a child. I washed it down with some Pacifico.
</p>
<p>
 People were sweet in the bar, and we met so many people up for a chat. There was a DJ all night, but at some point the atmosphere shifted to one where everyone was dancing. I wish we stayed longer, but after a few shimmies and stanky legs together, we left to go sleep. Even the walk to our place late at night in Arcata was a lovely one though. Maybe it was the air in the night that day, maybe my amazing love with whom the conversation just flowed so easy, or perhaps it was the beer brewing in my stomach.
</p>
<p>
 We went to downtown Eureka for a small stroll the night after, and while it’s true that it was likely empty due to it being between Christmas and NYE, it was unsettlingly dead. Arcata Plaza 1, Eureka downtown 0.

 After a wet four days, all we had left was the drive home.
</p>
<p>
 What’s the best part of a road trip? Is it just that I can eat nothing but peach rings for hours while driving? Is it the feeling of passing dozens of communities that are all slightly different and containing their own worlds, begging for you to stop by? Perhaps the safety in the idea that you’re shielded by your car from any heavy rain outside? Maybe it’s playing fun car games, seemingly never getting bored by another round of categories. Or no, it’s got to be the languid conversations you have as you drive by enourmous vast forests, right? No, it’s that when you get back home, despite how tired you are; you have all these wonderful memories and photos for life.
</p>

<p>
 Thank you for reading, I hope this was slightly enjoyable to read albeit just being a casual road trip writing. There’s also multiple things I’m working on currently, spanning many different topics, some more analytical or more casual than others. But at their heart, they are all a part of the south bay. I can’t wait to write those and share them too.

 Hopefully I do want to stick to some kind of schedule with posting, but there’s been a lot of stressors in my life recently, but they’re all slowly cooling down. This substack is one of my favorite things in my life right now and I’m just wanting to write more and more. Stay tuned!
