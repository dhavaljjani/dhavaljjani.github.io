 At the Mountain View public library on Tuesdays, between 1 and 5 PM, a dimension to the past can be found. The history center opens up upstairs, and a portal to bygone times is available. Old government documents, fire insurance maps, original Ohlone tools, informational pamphlets, high school yearbooks, submitted photos, previous city magazines, aerial imagery, and more from the local area overflow in the two small rooms in which they reside.
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m lucky enough to work on Castro Street right by the library, so I&rsquo;ve been able to check out the historical resources twice so far. And hopefully I&rsquo;ll be going back many more times, because what I&rsquo;ve picked up about local history there could not have been found or learned in any other way. I mean, did you know that the California state reptile is a desert tortoise due to the eager students of Benjamin Bubb School in Mountain View, who brought up the matter all the way up to President Nixon.
</p>
<p>
 Most of the collection present in the archives can&rsquo;t be taken or checked out of the library, and while lots of it is digitized on
 <a href="https://californiarevealed.org/partner/mountain-view-public-library">
  California Revealed
 </a>
 and the
 <a href="https://archive.org/details/mountainviewlibrary">
  Internet Archive
 </a>
 , I recommend you go there in person for the full experience plus the expertise present in the librarians (especially the wonderful James).
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;ve spent some time looking through the collection, and I thought I could share some of my favorite historical findings so far, along with any contextual information I can find. And a reminder; this isn&rsquo;t even close to half the stuff I had seen, which doesn&rsquo;t even encompass like a quarter of the total collection. I highly recommend going there for yourself if you find this interesting, or have lived in Mountain View and the surrounding areas for any amount of time!

 For starters, I really enjoyed finding this photo featuring Castro Street dated to around 1920ish. Back when Mountain View was simply a stage coach stop on the journey from San Francisco to The Valley. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy to think that so much of this development comes as a result of the success of SF and the gold rush in 1849. Side note, did anyone else do the Gold Dust or Bust play in elementary school? That was a large part of my childhood.
</p>
<p>
 Here&rsquo;s the old photo of Castro Street (circa 1910) though:

 I lined up the photo with modern day Castro Street and Mountain View. The helpful prominent features here are the Jurian building on the right (now housing the upscale Mexican bistro Agave) and the original bank building on the left (where Red Rock Cafe now resides). Here&rsquo;s a view from the same angle but now:

 Seems like we&rsquo;ve shrunk the view of the mountains from this particular angle, but there&rsquo;s so many trees and outdoor seating spaces on Castro Street now! As a whole, even before the street was pedestrianized after COVID, Castro Street has changed its character and configuration numerous times over its history. Here&rsquo;s some more old clicks of Castro&hellip;

 The gorgeous hand drawn compass aside, this map shows some really cool history. In the center, we can see the intersection between Stevens Creek Boulevard and a road that is shown as &ldquo;Mountain View&rdquo; to the north, and &ldquo;Saratoga&rdquo; to the south. Both make sense as names of the road, to show drivers where the roads can take them, but it was later renamed to Sunnyvale-Saratoga Road. However, eventually the City of Cupertino changed this as well. Cupertino was not a huge fan of having a major thoroughfare of their city named after two neighboring cities - hence the portions of this road that go through Cupertino were renamed De Anza Boulevard, named after Juan Bautista de Anza of the Spanish Empire. Fun fun.
</p>
<p>
 We can also see the Calabazas Creek cutting through the land on the right, and what is dubbed the &ldquo;Cupertino Creek&rdquo; on the left. You may recognize it by the name Stevens Creek instead though.
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, if you look at all the parcels and lots shown you&rsquo;ll see the names of people who presumably owned the land. Their ownership of the land lends itself to so many modern streets and parks and schools that are named after these people and their families today. Here&rsquo;s some I noticed; let me know if you find more!

 <li>

 It&rsquo;s interesting to see what everyone&rsquo;s land is now, and how the roads have developed in the 138 years that have followed. The freeways that cut up the area are very apparent (I-280 and SR-85). Jollyman Park lies wholly within the property of &ldquo;FM Jollyman&rdquo; which makes sense but it&rsquo;s still just plain cool to see.

 Recently, I&rsquo;ve grown an infatuation with geolocating photos, thanks to one of my favorite YouTubers:

 My mom was fairly certain this was Paris. After painstakingly looking through every single bridge in Paris on Google Street View, I found the exact bridge it was; Pont Neuf in Paris. The sign that looked like an Austrian flag in the back almost threw me off, but eventually I realized it was a French sign for no entry. The buildings in the back align almost perfectly:

 My mom had told me it was somewhere in Switzerland, and knowing we had visited Jungfrau mountain while there helped me start. I began looking through every train station around the town of Interlaken (where we had been) and Jungfrau mountain. After a couple hours in which I saw too many train stations that looked almost exactly the same (curse you Wengernalp!); I stumbled upon Kleine Scheidegg, a small mountain pass with a station:

 Perfect match, and I was two for two. Looking for a different type of challenge, I looked for some photos in the historical center that lacked an address.
</p>
<p>
 Of all the photos I was able to look through, one caught my eye AND lacked an address or location on the back of it or online. A mystery awaiting me?
</p>
<p>
 I&rsquo;m sure someone out there might recognize this immediately. But for me, I had no clue. And I thought it would be a fun mystery and hunt to locate exactly which building this image is in. And boy did it send me on a wild goose chase.

 It&rsquo;s a wall-to-wall building, and I immediately assumed it would be in downtown Mountain View, somewhere on Castro Street. Possibly University Avenue or California Street in Palo Alto, but I figured Castro Street was a better bet. I opened up Google Street View and found a potential candidate for the building in the first five minutes of looking:

 Looking back as far in time as Google Street View would let me, here&rsquo;s the building a little further back in 2007.

 Okay, I like it. The building on the left aligns particularly well, along with the tiling of the main building&rsquo;s base. But a big thing that sticks out is that the entrance is on the side in our old photo, whereas this building has it in the middle. But, it&rsquo;s very likely the storefront could have been changed since the early 1900s.
</p>
<p>
 Eventually, through the address of the building above, I was able to find the building history of 292 Castro Street. It was constructed in 1930
 <a href="https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/37761477/292-Castro-St-Mountain-View-CA-94041/">
  according to PropertyShark
 </a>
 , which was helpful and aligned with the alleged date of the photo. I found the assessor's cadastral map for the parcel (158-13-46), but that was of little help too.
</p>
<p>
 I looked to see if I could find anything else about JV Manfredi. I was able to find a photo on the Internet Archive of what is likely
 <a href="https://archive.org/details/cmv_000357">
  a family residence on El Camino Real
 </a>
 . I also found a photo of a
 <a href="https://archive.org/details/cmv_000474">
  young JV Manfredi in a dress
 </a>
 , allegedly crying. Neither were particularly helpful. The latter was slightly amusing though.
</p>
<p>
 I realized that if the facade for 292 Castro Street truly was changed since the early 1900s, I could find it in the online archives. I began hunting for photos of Castro Street - primarily near the intersection with W Dana Street where this building is. After looking at dozens and dozens of historic photos of Castro Street from the early 1900s, I came tantalizingly close. A photo of exactly the cross streets I wanted&hellip; but looking east rather than west. Mr Manfredi&rsquo;s store could be lying just on the other side of this photo:

 Heartbroken, I realized catching a glimpse of this specific building in an old photo was near impossible. My computer&rsquo;s RAM cried as I opened up dozens and dozens of photos and tabs looking. After another ten minutes, I stumbled upon a peculiar photo:

 Was that&hellip; the same building? The building was flipped but I thought it could solely be the image that was flipped. The glass storefront matched up too well, and a realty company and insurance company residing in the same building but in different times made sense to me. Shame this one also lacked an address apparently. I feel it is possible that this is the same building as Mr Manfredi&rsquo;s office though.
</p>
<p>
 Close to giving up, I decided to use the resources I had available. I decided to try and consult with James, the superman librarian. He was glad to take a look, and upon cross-reference with some newspaper clippings&hellip;he found it. He informed me that it was 268 Castro Street - just two buildings to the right of the one I had been looking so far into. Finally, the photo had an address associated with it.

 Mr Manfredi, I&rsquo;ve found you! Mostly thanks to James, but still. I don&rsquo;t know why your building was changed so much. I don&rsquo;t know how long your office stayed at 268 Castro Street. I don&rsquo;t even know if you really did cry because of that dress the photo of you as a child implied. But Mr Manfredi, from one Castro Street worker to another, your town is still here and it is thriving.

 I&rsquo;ve been seeing some higher readership on the South Bay Journal as a whole recently which has really made my month. Anyone reading this now, you&rsquo;re kind to even feign interest in my writing. If you enjoyed this one, drop a comment and I&rsquo;ll try to check out more historical centers around the bay and San Jose - hopefully picking up some Indigenous history about the Native Americans present before the Spanish and American colonial settlers too.
</p>
<p>
 Thank you, and I&rsquo;ll see you next week to talk about yet another inane topic probably.
